THE CHAIR<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE CASE OF A HAUNTED HOUSE IN RED LION
SQUARE</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> not a psychometrist&mdash;at least not to any great
extent. I cannot pick up a small object&mdash;say an
old ring or coin&mdash;and straightway tell you its
history, describing all the people and incidents
with which it has been associated. Yet, occasionally,
odd things are revealed to me through some
strange ornament or piece of furniture.</p>

<p>The other day I went to see a friend, who was
staying in a flat near Sloane Square, and I was
much impressed by a chair that stood on the
hearthrug near the fire. Now I am not a connoisseur
of chairs; I cannot always ascribe dates
to them. I can, of course, tell whether they are
oak or mahogany, Chippendale or Sheraton, but
that is about all. It was not, however, the make
or the shape of this chair that attracted me, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
was the impression I had that something very
uncanny was seated on it. My friend, noticing
that I looked at it very intently, said: &ldquo;I will
tell you something very interesting about that
chair. It came from a haunted house in Red Lion
Square. I bought it at a sale there, and several
people who have sat in it since have had very
curious experiences. I won&rsquo;t tell you them till
after you&rsquo;ve tried it. Sit in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be any good,&rdquo; I answered;
&ldquo;you know I can&rsquo;t psychometrise, especially to
order. May I take it home with me for a few
nights?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My friend smilingly assented.</p>

<p>The chair was put in a taxi, and in less than
half an hour was safely lodged in my chambers.
I was living alone just then, for my wife had been
suddenly called away to the country, to the bedside
of an aged and ailing relative. I say alone,
but I had company&mdash;a lady tabby that, apparently
abandoned by her lover, persisted in showering
her attentions upon me. For hours at a time
she would perch on the writing-table in my bedroom,
whilst I was at work, and fix me amorously
with her big green eyes.</p>

<p>The moment, however, this most eccentric of
feline beauties perceived the chair, she sprang off
her pedestal and dived under the bed; and from
that hour to this I have never seen her. The
chair did not frighten me, but it brought a new,
and I cannot say altogether pleasant, atmosphere
into the place. When I was in bed and the gas was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
out, I could swear the chair moved, that it shifted
nearer and nearer the window&mdash;always the window,
as if it was most anxious to make its escape and
hie back to its old home. And again there were
times when, barred from this avenue of escape,
it rocked. Yes, I could distinctly hear it rock
backwards and forwards on the parquet floor with
ever increasing rapidity and violence, as though
blind with fury at being balked. And then,
again, it groaned, groaned in the deepest and
most hopeless misery&mdash;misery that the eternally
damned alone can know and suffer. Certain now
that there was something there that badly needed
human consolation, I addressed the chair, and,
failing to get any verbal answer from it, I tried
a code of raps. That failing, I sat in it for several
hours two successive nights, and experimented in
automatic writing. The result was nil. Resolving
to give it another trial, but this time without a
planchette, I chose a Friday night when the moon
was in the crescent, and placing the chair on one
side the hearth, facing the window, I threw myself
back in it and closed my eyes. For some
minutes I was still vividly conscious of the old
surroundings: the flickering fire flames&mdash;seen
through my closed lids; the old grandfather
clock on the landing outside solemnly ticking; the
eternal whistling and hooting of the taxis as they
whizzed along in the street beneath.</p>

<p>Then by degrees, quite imperceptibly, I lost
cognisance of all these things; and, intuitively, I
began to feel the presence of something strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and wholly novel in the room. I felt it steal
forth from a piece of dark and ancient tapestry
my wife had hung on the wall. It was merely a
shadow, an undefined shadow, a shadow such as
the moon, when very low in the heavens, might
possibly fashion from the figure of a man; but
yet it was not a man, nor a woman, nor anything
with which I was in any way familiar. For a
moment it stood still, watching me from its vague,
formless, indefinite eyes. Then it made a forward
movement, stood still again, and yet once again
advanced.</p>

<p>Coming up behind my chair, it bent low over me,
and placing its long, cool spirit hands over my
eyelids, imparted to me a steadily increasing sense
of numbness. All thought was gradually annihilated;
it was succeeded by a blank, just such a
blank as suddenly comes to one when in the hands
of the anæsthetist. Now, up to this evening, I had
presumed, as nearly everybody does presume, that,
in the case of mental blanks, every particle of consciousness
is lost, totally arrested, and held, for
the time being, in complete subjection. But on
this occasion&mdash;at the very moment memory reasserted
itself&mdash;I had recollections of some great
metempsychosis, some stupendous change in my
entire constitution, a change that affected all that
we term mind, and spirit, and soul.</p>

<p>I struggled earnestly and desperately to recall
the exact nature and process of that change, which
I now believe underlies all so-called blanks, and I
achieved this much: I recalled travel&mdash;a mad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
rushing plunge or descent into something&mdash;something
quite different from anything I had known
before&mdash;a descent into some plane, or sphere, or
condition, wholly and completely apart from the
physical, and what is generally understood and
classified as the mental plane, sphere, or condition.
In my efforts to recollect, I have arrived at that
same pitch since; but whenever I have been on
the verge of getting beyond it, of forcing back a
minute recollection of how that metempsychosis
was enacted, of all the stages in it, there has been a
lapse&mdash;my memory has dimmed. Yet brief and
slight as these remembrances have been, they have
assured me of one great truth, namely&mdash;that the
state of blank never actually exists. Some part
of us&mdash;the part that alone retains consciousness&mdash;is
extracted and borne far away from the actual
material body; but on its return, on its reunion
with the physical&mdash;with our gross and carnal,
earthly self&mdash;all memory of this delicate and finely
poised consciousness is at once swallowed up and
obliterated. If such were not the case, if everything
were indeed a blank, and the spiritual as
well as the material part of us were suspended
during what we term unconsciousness, we should
be forced to the conclusion that the soul has no
separate existence, that it cannot survive the body,
and that the immortality of man, the infinite
perpetuation of our identity, in which we have so
fondly believed, is but a chimera. I am, however,
certain&mdash;I could, if need be, swear to it&mdash;that even
in the deepest slumber, in the wildest delirium, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the most seemingly omnipotent and annihilating
blank, all is not lost, something remains, and
that something is the psychic and spiritual consciousness,
the very thing that constitutes what
we term soul. In the first stage, then, of my cognisance
of thought, again I struggled with memory,
and the struggle overcoming me, I gradually lapsed
into the mere consciousness of existence without
thought. How long this condition lasted I cannot
say, but with startling abruptness thought
returned, and I became madly anxious to ascertain
my present state&mdash;how it differed from my former&mdash;and
my whereabouts. I was conscious of sound
and light and motion, but conscious of them merely
from the point of observation, as things quite outside
myself&mdash;things that in no way sensibly affected
me. What particularly impressed me was the
silence&mdash;the passivity&mdash;of what, I believed, constituted
my body. I could detect no heart movement,
no pulsation whatever. I seemed to be
there&mdash;to have a very familiar form&mdash;but to be
nothing more than form&mdash;to have no tangibility.
So far my eyes had seen; but, purposely, I had not
allowed myself to discriminate objects. I was
intuitively certain my power of vision had become
supernormal; and I dreaded to employ it for fear
I should see too much&mdash;too acutely. I had a
stupendous sense of impending horror. At length,
however, I was impelled by an irresistible fascination
to look. I did so, and in an instant became
the spectator of a drama. Before me, seated at a
grimy wooden table, were two men, clad in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
fascinating garb of the latter part of the eighteenth
century&mdash;long coat, befrilled vest, knee breeches,
and peruke. Two mugs of ale were placed in front
of them, and the one man kept on sipping, while
the other, seldom touching the ale, took long and
vigorous puffs at a pipe. The room had a very
low ceiling, blackened with smoke, and traversed
by enormous oaken beams; a chimney corner, in
which sat an old man, munching something out of
a very dirty-looking bag, and, at the same time,
taking occasional pinches of snuff; and a couch,
stowed away in one corner, and piled several feet
high with a variety of books, papers, cushions, and
wearing apparel.</p>

<p>The general atmosphere of the place suggested
an inn or tavern. It was with the two men in the
foreground, however, that something told me I
was most concerned. They appeared to be about
the same age and of the same class; but there all
similarity ended. The one was tall and thin, with
dark, deep-set, and very restless eyes&mdash;and oddly
noticeable hands. They were large and sinewy, with
peculiarly long fingers and protruding knuckles.
His companion was small and shrivelled, with
watery blue eyes and a particularly weak mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange we should meet like this, John,&rdquo; the
shorter of the two remarked, taking a big gulp of
ale. &ldquo;Ten years since we last saw one another,
and that was in Bristol. Do you recollect the
occasion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I recollect it?&rdquo; the other responded.
&ldquo;Can I ever forget it? You had just come from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
her. She had accepted you. Money, of course.
I had nothing to offer her but love. Love!
What&rsquo;s the good of love without prospects?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a fair fight, John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair fight, Wilfred!&rdquo; John replied. &ldquo;You
may call it fair, if you like, but I don&rsquo;t. What
chance had I when you pointed to your bank-book
and said, &lsquo;If I die I can settle all that on her&rsquo;? I
could promise nothing. I hadn&rsquo;t a cent in the
world beyond my weekly pay. Thirty shillings.
And how pleased you were with yourself when you
came to see me that last evening in Bristol. Do
you remember what you said? &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the fortune
of war, my boy. You&rsquo;ll soon get over it. Work.&rsquo;
As if I didn&rsquo;t work! But I took your advice,
though I hated you for it; and I left Bristol.
After what had happened I loathed the place. An
uncle of mine offered me a clerkship in his office
in Holborn, and I stuck so hard to my job that I
eventually became a partner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a rich man, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comfortable, but not rich, Wilfred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve forgiven me? Got over that
little love affair, eh? Well, well. Matrimony is
not all bliss, John. At least that was my experience.
Poor Jenny! But of course I have not
told you. I&rsquo;m much to be pitied, John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; Wilfred said, filling his mug with ale
and raising it to his lips, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m a lonely widower.
But how did you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe me if I told you,&rdquo; John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
replied. &ldquo;I get my information through channels
that are barred to men like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Witchcraft, I suppose,&rdquo; Wilfred said, with a
sneer. &ldquo;But why this mystery? Someone in
Bristol city wrote to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; John answered. &ldquo;I know
no one in Bristol city now. Your first suggestion
was nearer the truth. Your wife, Wilfred, often
comes to see me. I know all about the way in which
you treated her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way in which I treated her!&rdquo; Wilfred
cried, starting upright in his chair, his face flushing
angrily. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s truth, man, what do you mean
by such a statement?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean exactly what I say,&rdquo; John answered.
&ldquo;For the first two years you treated her tolerably
well. Then someone else caught your fancy.
Jenny was neglected, despised, and on one occasion
actually beaten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; Wilfred gasped, springing to his feet,
as if to leave the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; John retorted, &ldquo;and you know
it. Come, sit down, man, and go on drinking.
Love never was in your line, drink is. Besides, as
you say, she&rsquo;s dead, and what&rsquo;s the use of quarrelling
over a corpse, even though she were beautiful
as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t finish his sentence, but
leaning forward thrust Wilfred back into his
chair.</p>

<p>For some seconds the two men sat and looked at
one another&mdash;Wilfred sullen, frightened, and resentful;
John imperturbable save for the perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
restless movement of his eyes, and an occasional
peculiar twitching of his upper lip and hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A rum,&rdquo; John said at length, &ldquo;or a gin? Or
both?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, let it be rum.&rdquo; He called the
waiter, and a rum was served.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not drinking to-day, John,&rdquo; Wilfred
remarked, taking a long pull at the rum and looking
more amiable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m quite off spirits,&rdquo; John replied&mdash;&ldquo;at
least, spirits of that kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spirits of that kind!&rdquo; Wilfred sniggered. &ldquo;Why,
whatever other kind of spirits are there? What a
mysterious fellow you are, John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; John laughed. &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ve reason
to be. I live in a big house, all alone, in Red Lion
Square.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;New houses, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Wilfred commented.
&ldquo;And big rents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John nodded, the same nod answering apparently
both questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me yet,&rdquo; Wilfred went on,
&ldquo;how you knew Jenny was dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her,&rdquo; John said very quietly. &ldquo;She
comes to me regularly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen her? Comes to you regularly? You must
be mad, John&mdash;mad or hoaxing. How can you
see her, and why should she come to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you you wouldn&rsquo;t believe me,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;No one does. Yet I can swear to you it&rsquo;s true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
She appeared to me last night and told me you
would be here this afternoon. That is how I
happened to meet you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You overwork yourself, John,&rdquo; Wilfred said,
taking another long pull at the rum. &ldquo;Too much
work is just as harmful to one&rsquo;s temperament and
chances in life as too little. Moderation, my
boy, moderation, I say. That&rsquo;s always been my
keynote. I should like to see this house of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall,&rdquo; John said, &ldquo;and the spirits. Not
hers&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think you will see hers&mdash;but the rum
and brandy. I&rsquo;ve excellent brands of both&mdash;smuggled
over from abroad last week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you don&rsquo;t drink!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I got them in entirely for your benefit.
Come. We will go to my house. It&rsquo;s more comfortable
than here. A big fire, nice easy chairs,
tobacco, and bottles&mdash;bottles with plenty in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve forgiven me, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgiven you!&rdquo; John replied, rising from the
table and putting on his hat. &ldquo;Forgiven you!
Do you think I should ask you round to my house,
to drink the best vintage London can offer you,
if I hadn&rsquo;t? Come. Come along at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wilfred rose with some difficulty from his seat,
and the two men went out into the street. The
scene then changed, and I found myself in a big,
gloomy house, following them up a long flight of
wooden stairs.</p>

<p>The moment I entered the house I became the
victim of an anomalous species of fear. I saw
nothing, but I instinctively knew that strange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
indefinable presences were there, watching us with
sphinx-like faces. I felt them, standing in the doorways,
lurking in the angles of the hall and landings,
and peering down at us from over the balustrades.
I felt that they were merely critical at present,
merely deliberating what attitude they should
adopt towards us; and I felt that the whole atmosphere
of the house was impregnated with a sense
of the utmost mystery&mdash;a mystery soluble only
to those belonging, in the truest sense, to the
spirit world&mdash;Neutrarians&mdash;spirit entities generated
solely from spirit essence and never incarcerated
in any material body&mdash;spirits initiated into one and
all of the idiosyncrasies of spirit land. The man
John gave no outward signs of being in any way
affected by these presences; but it was otherwise
with Wilfred. The silence and darkness of the
house unmistakably disturbed him, and as he
panted up the staircase, following his long and lean
host with none too steady a step, he cast continual
looks of apprehension about him. First, I saw him
peer over his shoulders, down the stairs behind him,
as if he fancied something, to which he could apply
no name, might be treading softly at his heels;
then I watched his eyes wander nervously to the
gloomy space overhead; and then, as if drawn by
some extremely unwelcome magnet, to the great,
white, sinewy hands of John. Arriving on the
second floor, they crossed a broad landing and
entered a spacious room, which was fitfully illuminated
by a few dying embers in a large open grate.
John produced a tinder box, lighted a trio of tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
wax candles, and resuscitated the fire. He then
left the room, reappearing in a few minutes with
an armload of bottles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make yourself comfortable, Wilfred,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Take that easy chair and pull it up in front of the
fire. Rum or brandy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wilfred, whose eyes glittered at the sight of the
spirits, chose rum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a little brandy
afterwards,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just to wash down the
rum. Moderation is my password, John, everything
in moderation,&rdquo; and, helping himself to the
rum, he laughed. John sat opposite him, and I
noticed, not without some emotion, that the chair
he took was the exact counterpart of the one in
which I had left my material ego.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; Wilfred exclaimed after a while, &ldquo;this
house is most extraordinarily still. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like
such stillness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He was more than half drunk.
&ldquo;Why do you live alone? Damned silly habit to
live alone in a house like this.&rdquo; Then he swallowed
a big gulp of rum and leered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All habits are silly,&rdquo; John replied. &ldquo;All life
is silly. Death alone is sensible. Death&rsquo;s a fine
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was a pause; and a gust of wind,
blowing up the staircase, set the door jarring and
made the windows rattle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that remark of yours, John,&rdquo;
Wilfred suddenly stuttered. &ldquo;Death&rsquo;s a fine
thing?&mdash;Death&rsquo;s the work of the devil. It&rsquo;s the
only thing I fear. And the&mdash;the wind. What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>From the hall below there came a gentle slam,
the soft closing of a door.</p>

<p>John shrugged his shoulders and stirred the logs
until they gave out a big blaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a noise,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This house is full of
noises. Every house is full of noises, if only you
take the trouble to listen for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another pause, and Wilfred helped himself to some
brandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noises, like women,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;want keeping
in their places. They&rsquo;ve no business wandering
about on nights like this. Hark!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The faintest sound possible broke the stillness
of the house; but it suggested much. To me it
was like a light, bounding footfall on the first flight
of stairs, those nearest the hall.</p>

<p>After listening a moment John spoke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
only Jenny,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;at least, I fancy it&rsquo;s only
Jenny. But there are others. God alone knows
whence they come or why. The house at times is
full of them. So far I have only felt their presence&mdash;and
heard. Pray to Heaven I may never see
them&mdash;at least, not some. Do you hear that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a gentle rustling on the landing, a
swishing, such as might have been caused by someone
in a silk dress with a long train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;it&rsquo;s Jenny!&rdquo; John went on. &ldquo;I told
you&mdash;she comes every night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wilfred made no reply, but the hand that held
the glass shook so much that the brandy ran over
and splashed on the floor.</p>

<p>There was again silence, then a creak, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
faint but very unmistakable turning of a door
handle.</p>

<p>Wilfred&rsquo;s face blanched. He tried to look round,
but dared not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid too,&rdquo; John murmured, his teeth
slightly chattering. &ldquo;I never can get over my
initial terror when she first arrives. God! What
horror I have known since I lived here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latch of the door gave a click, the sort of
click it always gives when the door springs open,
and a current of icy air blew across the room and
fanned the cheeks of both men. Wilfred attempted
to speak, but his voice died away in his throat.
He glanced at the window. It was closed with
heavy wooden shutters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; John sighed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no escape
that way. Make up your mind to face it&mdash;face
<span class="f8">HER</span>. Ah!&rdquo; He sank back as he spoke and
closed his eyes.</p>

<p>I looked at Wilfred. His vertebrae had totally
collapsed; he sat all huddled up in his chair, his
weak, watery eyes bulging with terror, and the
brandy trickling down his chin on to his cravat.
All this scene, I must tell you, was to me most
vivid, most acutely vivid, although I was but a
passive participator in it. The same feeling that
had possessed me on my entrance into the house
was with me even in a greater measure now. I
felt that pressing on the heels of this wind, this
icy blast of air, were the things from the halls and
landings, the distractingly enigmatical and ever-deliberating
things. I felt them come crowding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
into the room; felt them once again watching.
Something now seemed to go wrong with the
wicks of all three candles; they burned very low,
and the feeble, flickering light they emitted was of
a peculiar bluish white. While I was engaged in
pondering over this phenomenon my eye caught
a sudden movement in the room, and I saw what
looked like a cylindrical pillar of mist sweep across
the floor and halt behind John. It remained
standing at the back of his chair for a second or
so, and then, retracing its way across the floor,
disappeared through the door, which, opening
wide to meet it, closed again with a loud bang.
John opened his eyes and reaching forward poured
himself out some brandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you I didn&rsquo;t drink spirits,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but her visit to-night has made a difference.
Come, Wilfred, pull yourself together. The ghosts&mdash;at
least her ghost has gone; and as for the others,
well, they don&rsquo;t count. Even you may get used
to them in time. Come, come, be a man. For
a sceptic, a confirmed sceptic, I never saw anyone
so frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Appealed to thus, Wilfred slowly straightened
himself out, and peeping round furtively at the
door, as if to make sure it really was shut, he helped
himself to some more brandy. John leaned forward
and regarded him earnestly. After some
minutes Wilfred spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those candles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t they
burn properly? I have never seen candles behave in
that fashion before. John, I don&rsquo;t like this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>John laughed. &ldquo;Matter of taste and habit,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it at first, but I like it
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another pause, and then John said suddenly,
&ldquo;More brandy, Wilfred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve had enough,&rdquo; Wilfred replied, &ldquo;enough.
John, I must be going home. See me to the door,
John; the front door, I mean, John. See me to
the door, there&rsquo;s a good fellow.&rdquo; He tried to rise,
but John put out one hand and pushed him gently
back into his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early yet,&rdquo; John said, &ldquo;far too early to
go home. Think what a long time it is since we
last met. Ten whole years. To some people
almost a lifetime. Are you tired of life, Wilfred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tired of life?&rdquo; Wilfred echoed. &ldquo;Tired of
brandy, perhaps, but not of life. What a question
to ask! Why?&rdquo; And again glancing furtively
at the door he tried to rise.</p>

<p>Once more John put out his hand and thrust him
back. &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the hour is far too
early. What were we talking about? Being tired
of life. Of course you are not. How foolish of me
to ask you such a thing! You who are so rich,
respected, admired, beloved. You are happy in
spite of your sad bereavement. You are a man to
be missed. With me it is otherwise. I long to go
to the spirit land, for it is there only I have friends,
really genuine, loving friends. I am not afraid to die.
I want death. I yearn for it. Yearn for it, Wilfred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spirits! Death! Always spirits and death
in your company,&rdquo; Wilfred responded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
talk of something else&mdash;something more cheerful.
I want cheering, John. This house of yours is
depressing&mdash;most horribly depressing. You say it
is new?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comparatively new,&rdquo; John replied, and he
started fumbling in his vest pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comparatively new,&rdquo; Wilfred repeated, his
eyes watching John&rsquo;s fingers attentively,&mdash;&ldquo;and
it has ghosts. Why, I thought it was only old
houses that were haunted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John chuckled. &ldquo;So people say,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;and they tell me I am mad to think there are
ghosts here. They say it is impossible. What is
your opinion, Wilfred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Wilfred said, watching John&rsquo;s movements
with increasing interest, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my opinion
too. A house to be haunted must have a history.
And this house has none, has it? John!&rdquo; The
last syllable was uttered in an altogether different
tone. It was not the voice of a drunken man.</p>

<p>For a brief moment John hesitated, trembled. He
seemed to be in the throes of some great mental
strain, some acute psychological crisis. But he
speedily overcame it, and drawing his hand out
suddenly from his vest, he produced a huge, murderous-looking
clasp knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;true. So far this house has
no history. No history whatever. But it will
have one, Wilfred. It will.&rdquo; And baring the blade
of his formidable weapon, he crouched low and
crept forward.</p>

<p class="dots">.<span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day I took the chair back to its owner.
I had had enough of it&mdash;quite enough; and I told
him my experiences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Odd!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very odd. The impressions
you received when sitting in the chair are almost
identical with those of the other people who have
sat in it. I wonder if a murder did actually take
place in that house? I shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised.
There is an old stain on the floor of one
of the rooms on the second landing, and they say
that, despite the most vigorous washing, it still
retains its colour&mdash;red, blood-red.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a><span class="g">CHAPTER II</span><br />
<br />
THE HEAD<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">A DERBYSHIRE HAUNTING</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> few years ago, two men were trudging along
a road, not twenty miles from Sudbury, swearing
heartily. It was not the first time they had sworn,
not by any means, but it is extremely doubtful if
either of them had ever sworn before quite so vehemently.
There were, one must admit, extenuating
circumstances. Having missed the last train, they
were obliged to walk home, a distance of twelve
or more miles, and having been overtaken by a rainstorm,
they were soaked to the skin. True, the
rain had now ceased, but as they had covered only
six miles, they still had six more to go, and at every
step they took, the water in their boots soaked
through their socks and squished between their
toes. Just as they arrived at a spot where the road
swerved a little to their left and took a sudden dip,
a clock from a distance solemnly chimed twelve.</p>

<p>The younger of the two men came to a halt and
lighted his pipe. &ldquo;Hold on a minute, Brown,&rdquo;
he shouted; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep up this infernal pace
any longer. Let&rsquo;s take an easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brown turned and joined his companion, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
had seated himself on a wooden gate. Below them,
in the dip, the darkness was sepulchral. The
hedges on either side the road were of immense
height; and high above them rose the trunks of
giant pines and larches, the intertwining branches of
which formed an archway that completely obliterated
the sky. A faint speck of light from afar
flickered occasionally, as if through a gap in the
foliage; but, apart from this, the men could see
nothing&mdash;nothing but blackness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cheerful spot!&rdquo; Brown remarked, &ldquo;as gloomy
a bit of road as I&rsquo;ve ever seen. And how quiet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other man blew his nose. &ldquo;Not so quiet
now,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;but how everything echoes!
What&rsquo;s that? Water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both men looked, and, apparently, from the
other side of the hedge, came the gentle gurgle of
quick flowing water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must be a spring,&rdquo; Brown observed, &ldquo;flowing
into some stream in the hollow. The darkness suggests
the Styx. A match, if you please, Reynolds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reynolds gave him one, and for awhile the two
men puffed away in silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly something whizzed overhead; and they
heard the prolonged, dismal hooting of an owl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is getting a bit too eerie, even for my liking,
Brown,&rdquo; Reynolds remarked; &ldquo;supposing we move
on. I always associate noises like that with a
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it were my mother-in-law&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Brown
laughed, &ldquo;or my own. But there&rsquo;s no such luck.
I&rsquo;m cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; Reynolds replied. &ldquo;Deuced cold!
Come on, do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slid off the gate as he spoke and strode into
the centre of the road.</p>

<p>The moon, temporarily unveiled, revealed as wet
a landscape as one could possibly imagine. Everything
dripped water&mdash;bushes, trees, ferns, grass,
hats, clothes&mdash;whilst every rut of the road, every
particle of soil, shone wet in the moon&rsquo;s rays. A
deep, settled calm permeated the atmosphere. It
was the stillness of night and moisture combined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rdquo;
Brown asked impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; Reynolds replied. &ldquo;I believe
I heard footsteps. Hark! I thought so, they&rsquo;re
coming this way! Someone else lost their train,
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brown listened, and he, too, distinctly heard the
sound of footsteps&mdash;high-heeled shoes walking
along with a sharp, springy action, as if the road
were absolutely hard and dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Odd hour for
a woman to be out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brown laughed. &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Women
are afraid of nothing nowadays except old age.
Hullo! Here she comes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke the figure of a woman&mdash;slight and
supple, and apparently young&mdash;shot into view, and
came rapidly towards them.</p>

<p>Her dress, though quaint and pretty, was not
particularly striking; but her feet, clad in patent
leather shoes, with buckles that shone brightly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the moonlight, were oddly conspicuous, in spite of
the fact that they were small and partially hidden
&rsquo;neath a skirt which was long and frilled, and not at
all in accordance with the present fashion. Something
about her prevented both men from speaking,
and they involuntarily moved nearer to one another
as she approached. On and on she came, tripping
along, and never varying her pace. Now in a zone
of moonlight, now in the dark belt of shadows
from the firs and larches, she drew nearer and
nearer. Through the hedge, Brown could dimly
perceive the figure of a cow, immensely magnified,
standing dumb and motionless, apparently
lost, like he was, in spellbound observation. The
silence kept on intensifying. Not a breath of air,
not a leaf stirring, not a sound from Reynolds,
who stood with arms folded like a statue; only
the subdued trickle, trickle of the spring, and the
hard tap, tap, tap of the flashing, sparkling shoes.</p>

<p>At last the woman was abreast of them. They
shrank back and back, pressing farther and farther
into the hedge, so close that the sharp twigs and
brambles scratched their faces and tore their
clothes. She passed. Down, down, down, still
tripping daintily, until the sepulchral blackness of
the dip swallowed her up. They could still hear
her tap, tap, tap; and for some seconds neither
spoke. Then Reynolds, releasing his clothes from
the thorns, muttered huskily: &ldquo;At last I&rsquo;ve seen
a ghost, and I always scoffed at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But her head!&rdquo; Brown ejaculated, &ldquo;where
was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; Reynolds replied, his teeth
chattering. &ldquo;She had no head. At least I didn&rsquo;t
see any. Dare you go on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, down there?&rdquo; Brown said, nodding
in the direction of the dip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we must, if we are to get home to-night,&rdquo;
Reynolds retorted, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m frozen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till that noise ceases, then,&rdquo; Brown answered.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand seeing a thing like that
twice in one night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood still and listened, until the tapping
gradually died away in the far distance, and the
only sound to be heard was that of the water,
the eternal, never ceasing, never varying sound of
the water. Then they ran&mdash;ran as they had never
run since long ago Rugby days&mdash;down through the
inky darkness of the hollow and out&mdash;far out into
the brightness of the great stretch of flat country
beyond; and, all the time they ran, they neither
looked to the right nor to the left, but always on
the ground just ahead of them.</p>

<p class="dots">.<span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span></p>

<p>For a week the horror of what they had seen was
so great that neither of the two men could bear to
be alone in the dark; and they kept a light in their
respective rooms all night. Then a strange thing
happened. Brown became infatuated, he did
nothing but rave, all day, about the ghost. She
had the prettiest figure, the whitest hands, the
daintiest feet he had ever seen, and he was sure her
face must be equally lovely. Why couldn&rsquo;t he see
it? There was nothing about the neck to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
she had been decapitated, and yet the head was
missing. Why?</p>

<p>He worried Reynolds to death about it, and he
gave no one else any peace. That waist, those delicate
white fingers, those rosy, almond-shaped nails,
those scintillating shoe buckles! They got on his
brain. They obsessed him. He was like a maniac.</p>

<p>At last, at the suggestion of Reynolds, who
wanted to get rid of him for awhile, he came up to
London and paid visits to most of the professional
mediums and occultists in the West End.</p>

<p>Some advised him one thing, and some another.
Some immediately went into trances and learned
from their controlling spirits all about the headless
phantom, who she was, why she paraded the high
road, and what had become of her head. But it
was significant that no two told him alike, and
that the head he so longed to see had at least a
dozen different hiding-places. At last, when he
had expended quite a small fortune, and his brain
was much addled with psychic nomenclature, with
detailed accounts of the Astral Plane, Karmas,
Elementals, Elementaries, White Lodges, and What
not, he interviewed a woman, living somewhere
in the Bayswater direction, who suggested that
he should hold a séance in the haunted hollow, and
who promised, with a great show of condescension,
to act as his medium if he would pay her the trifling
sum of twenty pounds.</p>

<p>At first Brown declared the thing impossible,
since he did not, at that moment, possess twenty
pounds, which was literally true; but the prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of seeing the ghost&rsquo;s face at length proved too
much for him, and he decided to pawn all he had,
in order to gratify his longing.</p>

<p>He closed with the offer. When the night fixed
for the séance arrived, the weather conditions were
all that could be desired; the air was soft and calm,
the moon brilliant, the sky almost cloudless, and
promising only the finest weather for days to come.
As the medium insisted upon a party of at least
four, Brown persuaded a Mr. and Mrs. de Roscovi,
Russians, to come, and they all set out together
from Sudbury shortly after ten o&rsquo;clock. Brown
had made many inquiries in the neighbourhood
as to the phantom figure, but he had only come
across two people who would tell him anything
about it. One, a farmer, assured him that he had
on several occasions seen the ghost when driving,
and that, on each occasion, it had kept abreast of his
horse, even though the latter was careering along the
road half mad with fright. But what terrified him
most, he said, was that the apparition had no head.</p>

<p>The other, a blacksmith, said he had seen the
woman twice, and that each time he had seen her
she had been carrying something tucked under her
arm, which he had fancied was a head. But he
had been too scared to look at it very closely, and
he only knew for certain that where her head
should have been there was nothing. Both he and
the farmer said they had heard all their lives that
the road was haunted, but for what reason they had
never been able to discover, as within the past sixty
years, at any rate, neither murder nor suicide was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
known to have taken place near the hollow. This
is as far as Brown had got with his investigations
when he set out from Sudbury on the night in
question. The de Roscovis did not think, for one
moment, that the ghost would appear. They said,
few people apparently had seen it; its visits in
all probability were only periodical; and weeks,
months, or even years might elapse before it put in
an appearance there again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be, but then we have a medium,&rdquo;
Brown argued. &ldquo;I engaged her to invoke the ghost,
provided it would not come of its own accord.
You can invoke it, can&rsquo;t you, Madame Valenspin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Valenspin now seemed rather dubious.
&ldquo;I have never tried in the open before,&rdquo; she said,
with a slight shiver, &ldquo;but I will do my best. The
conditions seem favourable; but I can&rsquo;t say definitely
till we arrive at the exact spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brown, however, could not help observing that
the farther they advanced into the country, which
became more and more lonely, the more restless
and uneasy Madame Valenspin grew.</p>

<p>Once or twice she halted, as if irresolute whether
to go on or not, and the moment she caught sight
of the hollow she came to a dead stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not down there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dark.
We&rsquo;d better stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was frightfully still. Brown listened for the
murmuring of water. There was none. The recent
hot sun had probably dried up the spring. Through
the same gap in the hedge he saw a big cow&mdash;possibly,
so he thought, the same cow&mdash;and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
took it as a favourable augury for the appearance
of the ghost that the animal, as before, was gazing
fixedly into the open space, as if momentarily expecting
to see something.</p>

<p>Behind it, away back in the broad expanse of
field, were other cattle, their skins startlingly white;
all motionless, and all in attitudes suggestive of a
sense of anticipation, of a conscious waiting for
something. The sepulchral hush was uninterrupted
saving by bats, assuredly the biggest and
blackest Brown had ever seen, wheeling and
skimming, with the faintest perceptible whiz, whiz,
whiz, in and out the larches; and the soft intermittent
fanning of the leaves as the night breeze
came rustling over the flat country and continued
its career down into the hollow. A rabbit scurried
across the road from one gate to another, its white
breast shining silver, and some other small furry
creature, of a species undetected, created a brief
pandemonium in a neighbouring ditch. Otherwise
all nature was extraordinarily passive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The figure went right down into the hollow,&rdquo;
Brown said. &ldquo;I think we ought to try there.
What do you think, Mrs. de Roscovi?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am of the same opinion as Madame Valenspin,&rdquo;
Mrs. de Roscovi replied, glancing apprehensively at the
dip. &ldquo;I think we had far better stay where we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; Brown said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s begin.
You are mistress of the ceremonies, Madame
Valenspin. Will you tell us what to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Valenspin moved to one side of the
road, and stood with her back resting against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
gate. &ldquo;Keep quite close to me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
I will try and go under control. Ah!&rdquo; She
ejaculated the last syllable so sharply that Brown
and Mrs. de Roscovi both started. She then
began to mumble something, and then, breaking
into a shrill, high-pitched key, stated that she was
no longer Madame Valenspin but a spirit called
Anne Heathcote, who was her temporary control.
Anne Heathcote, so the audience were informed,
was the ghost of a girl of very great beauty, who
had been murdered in an adjoining field, close on
a hundred years ago. There was no apparent
motive for the deed, which was accomplished in
a peculiarly barbarous fashion, the head being cut
right off and thrown in a pit that had long since
been filled in. The criminal was never caught.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you appear to us with your head on,&rdquo;
Brown asked, &ldquo;just as you were in your lifetime?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the alleged spirit replied. &ldquo;I am forbidden
to do so. My visits are only periodical, and I shan&rsquo;t
be able to materialise again here for at least ten years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is little hope of my ever seeing
you,&rdquo; Brown said, bitterly disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; was the somewhat abrupt answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why should you haunt this place at all?&rdquo;
Mr. de Roscovi asked. &ldquo;What reason is there
for your being earth-bound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sins,&rdquo; the control replied. &ldquo;I was a very
wicked girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether you were wicked or not,&rdquo;
Brown put in mournfully. &ldquo;I want to see you.
If your face is in keeping with your limbs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
figure, it must indeed be lovely. Is there no way
of seeing you&mdash;just for a second?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; the control answered. Then, with
much more emphasis, &ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But hardly had the alleged Anne Heathcote
spoken, when far away in the distance came the
sound of footsteps. Tap, tap, tap!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! By Jove!&rdquo; Brown shouted, &ldquo;there she is!
I recognise her step. I should know it in a million.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a minute everyone was silent, the tapping
growing more and more audible. Then Madame
Valenspin, in quite her own voice, exclaimed excitedly:
&ldquo;Let us be going. The spirits tell me
we mustn&rsquo;t remain here any longer. Let&rsquo;s go
back by the fields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fumbled with the latchet of the gate, against
which she had been leaning, and hurriedly tried to
raise it.</p>

<p>Mrs. de Roscovi said nothing, but gripped her
husband by the arm. The steps approached rapidly,
and presently the same dainty form, Brown had
previously seen when with Reynolds, once more
figured on the horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;it is she!&rdquo; Brown whispered. &ldquo;Look&mdash;the
waist, the arms, the hands, the shoes. Silver
buckles! How they flash!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An exclamation of horror interrupted him. It
was from Mr. de Roscovi. He had moved to one
side of the road, dragging his wife with him, and
the two were standing huddled together, their
eyes fixed in a frenzied stare at the phantom&rsquo;s
neck. Brown, forcing his attention away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the long slim hands which so fascinated him, followed
their glances. The neck was not as he remembered
it, white and slender as far as it went, but it ended
abruptly in a grey nothingness, and beyond this
nothingness Brown fancied he discerned the dimmest
of shadows. He was appalled but fascinated,
and intense curiosity far outweighed his fear. He
was certain she was beautiful&mdash;beautiful to a
degree that immeasurably excelled any feminine
loveliness he had hitherto encountered. He must
see her face. He did not believe her head was
missing; he believed it was there on her body right
enough, but that for some specific reason it had
not materialised. He turned to Madame Valenspin
to inquire the cause, and was greatly astonished
to see her beating a hasty retreat across the fields.
The figure had now come up to where he was
standing, and tripping past him, it sped swiftly
down the dip. Brown at once gave chase. He
had not gone many yards before the darkness of
the dip was on him; and the only clue he had
to his quarry&rsquo;s whereabouts was the sound of the
shoes&mdash;the constant tap, tap, tapping. On and
on he went, however, and at length, emerging from
the darkness, he perceived a wooden stile and
beyond it a tiny path, threading its way through
a clump of firs that gradually grew thinner and
thinner till they finally terminated in what appeared
to be a broad clearing. Mounting the stile
and springing off on the other side, the woman
tripped along the path, and, turning for a moment
to beckon Brown, disappeared from view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The intense loneliness of the spot, emphasised
a thousandfold by the eerie effect of the few straggling
moonbeams that fell aslant the stile and
pathway, and the knowledge that he had left his
companions far behind made Brown falter, and it
was some seconds before he could gather up the
courage to continue his pursuit. A light girlish
laugh, however, proceeding apparently from the
spot where the figure had vanished, determined
him. He saw once again vividly before him that
willowy waist, those slim, delicate fingers, and
those coquettish little feet. Were the devil itself
to bar his way he must see her face. Sweating
with terror, and yet withal obsessed with a passion
that defies description, Brown mounted the stile
and hastened in the direction of the laugh. Again
it rang out, charged to overflowing with innocent
fun and frolic, irresistibly girlish, irresistibly coy.
This time there was no mistaking its locality. It
came from behind a small clump of trees that
bordered on the clearing. Wild with excitement
and full of love madness, Brown dashed round the
clump, and then halted. Floating in mid-air was
a head, a head that looked as if it had long since
been buried and just disinterred. The eyes alone
lived, and they were fixed on Brown&rsquo;s with a mocking,
baneful glitter. Hanging on either side of it
was a mass of long fair hair, suggestive of a woman.</p>

<p>Every detail in the face stood out with hideous
clearness in the brilliancy of the moonlight, and as
Brown stared at it, petrified with horror, the thing
laughed.</p>

<br />
THE CUPBOARD<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">A CASE OF HAUNTINGS NEAR BIRMINGHAM</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">People</span> often wonder why new houses&mdash;houses
without any apparent history&mdash;should suddenly
begin to be haunted, often by a variety of very
alarming phenomena, and then, just as suddenly,
perhaps, cease to be haunted.</p>

<p>Of course one can only theorise, but I think a
very possible and feasible reason is suggested, in
the case I am about to relate.</p>

<p>Five years ago Sir George Cookham was living at
&ldquo;The Mayfields,&rdquo; a large country house some ten
or twelve miles south-east of Birmingham. He
was greatly interested in criminology, inclining to
the belief that crime is almost entirely due to
physical malformation; and used to invite all the
great experts on the subject to stay with him. It
was one week-end, towards the middle of September,
that Dr. Sickertorft came; and he and
Sir George had some very heated arguments. Sir
George was one of the most eccentric men I have
ever met, and one of his many idiosyncrasies was to
carry on his discussions walking.</p>

<p>On the morning of Sickertorft&rsquo;s departure he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Sir George were arguing&mdash;Sir George, at the same
time, perambulating the corridor of the ground
floor of the house, for about the hundredth time&mdash;when
Dr. Sickertorft suddenly remarked: &ldquo;I wonder
if this house is haunted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haunted!&rdquo; Sir George laughed. &ldquo;Why, of
course not. It&rsquo;s new. My father built it only
sixty years ago. A house to be haunted must be
old, must have some history. And the only tragedy
that has occurred here was when a servant I once
had, losing control of his temper, killed one of my
most valuable dogs. That was a tragedy, both for
the servant and the dog. There has been nothing
else to my knowledge&mdash;nothing beyond one or two
quite peaceful deaths from natural causes. But
why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Sickertorft replied, &ldquo;that cupboard
over there, opposite the foot of the stairs, to me,
strongly suggests a ghost. Something peculiarly
diabolical. Something that springs out on one
and imparts the sensation of being strangled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only ghosts that haunt that cupboard,&rdquo;
Sir George chuckled, &ldquo;are boots and shoes, and, I
believe, my fishing rods. Ghosts are all a delusion&mdash;a
peculiar state of the brain due to some
minute osseous depression or cerebral inflammation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; Sickertorft said
quietly. &ldquo;I am positively certain that there are
such things as ghosts, that they are objective and
of many kinds. Some, in all probability, have
always existed, and have never inhabited any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
human body; some are the earth-bound spiritual
egos of man and beast; and some we can create
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Create ghosts!&rdquo; Sir George cried. &ldquo;Come,
now, we are talking sense. Of course we can create
ghosts. Pepper did, Maskelyne and Devant still
do, and so do all the so-called materialising
mediums.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean spoof ghosts,&rdquo; Sickertorft responded.
&ldquo;I mean real ones. Real superphysical,
objective phenomena. Man can at times create
them, but only by intense concentration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean materialised thought forms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you like to term them such,&rdquo; Sickertorft
replied. &ldquo;I believe they are responsible for a
certain percentage of hauntings, but not all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never seen any of your ghostly
thought forms nor, in my opinion, am I ever likely
to,&rdquo; Sir George growled. &ldquo;Show me one and I&rsquo;ll
believe. But you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know so much,&rdquo; Sickertorft muttered,
and, with his eyes still on the cupboard, he followed
Sir George into his study.</p>

<p class="dots">.<span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span></p>

<p>A week later Lucy, a maid at &ldquo;The Mayfields,&rdquo;
was walking past the cupboard on her way to the
dining-room, when something, as she subsequently
described it to the cook, came over her, and she ran
for her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything nor see anything,&rdquo; she
explained. &ldquo;I only felt there was something
nasty hiding there, ready to spring out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The following night she had the same experience,
and her terror was so great that she ran shrieking
into the dining-room, and it was some moments
before she could make any coherent statement.
Lady Cookham was very angry with her, and said it
was all nonsense. There was nothing whatever
wrong with the cupboard, and, if it occurred again,
she must go. It did occur again, the very next
night, and Lucy, without waiting for her dismissal,
gave notice. She said this time she heard a laugh,
a low chuckle, very sinister, and suggestive also of
the utmost glee. The door of the cupboard
creaked and, she believed, opened a little; but on
this point she could not be absolutely certain. She
only knew her horror was infinitely greater than
it had been on former occasions, and that when she
ran, she was convinced something very dreadful
ran after her.</p>

<p>The following evening, just about the same time,
the butler went to the cupboard for a pair of shoes.
He had just picked them up, and was about to go off
with them, when someone breathed in his face. He
sprang back in astonishment, striking his head
somewhat badly against the edge of a shelf, whereupon
there was a laugh&mdash;a short, sharp laugh, expressive
of the keenest satisfaction. This was too
much for the butler. Dropping the shoes, he
dashed out of the cupboard and never ceased running
till he was in the servants&rsquo; quarters.</p>

<p>He told the housekeeper, and the housekeeper
mentioned the matter to the head parlourmaid;
so that in a very short time the whole household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
got to know of it, and the cupboard was given as
wide a berth as possible.</p>

<p>The next victim was the governess. Sir George
had two children, both girls, and at present they
were too young to go to school. The governess was
a Cambridge graduate, who boasted of being utterly
materialistic and of having a supreme contempt for
weak nerves, and, to quote her own words, &ldquo;poor
simpletons who believe in ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was passing the cupboard one evening,
three nights after the butler&rsquo;s experience, when an
irresistible impulse came over her to explore it.
She opened the door and stepped inside, then someone
closed the door with a bang and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the governess demanded.
&ldquo;Let me out at once. How dare you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no reply, but when she stretched out
her hand to feel for the door, she encountered something
very cold and spongy, and the horror of it
was so unexpected that she fainted.</p>

<p>In falling she struck the door violently. It
flew open, and she was found some seconds later in a
state of semi-insensibility, lying half in the cupboard
and half across the corridor.</p>

<p>When Lady Cookham heard of what had happened,
she was furious. &ldquo;The cupboard can&rsquo;t be haunted,&rdquo;
she declared, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ridiculous. Someone is playing
us a trick. I&rsquo;ll call in the police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The local inspector being summoned, examined
the cupboard and cross-questioned the servants.
But he discovered nothing. Lady Cookham now
determined to unravel the mystery&mdash;if mystery there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
were&mdash;herself. She gave all the servants save
one&mdash;the new maid Hemmings, whom she had
engaged in the place of Lucy&mdash;a fortnight&rsquo;s holiday,
and got in a supply cook from Coventry. The
governess was allowed to remain, but she was
strictly forbidden to go anywhere near the cupboard
after midday.</p>

<p>When evening arrived, Lady Cookham, arming
herself with a revolver and horsewhip, commenced
to watch. Her first vigil passed uneventfully;
but the next night, just as she had arrived at the
cupboard and was taking up her stand facing it,
the door slowly began to open. Lady Cookham is
about as good a specimen of the thoroughly practical,
strong-minded English sportswoman as one could
meet anywhere. Up to the commencement of the
present war she rode regularly with the Pytchley
hounds, had a cold douche bath every morning, and
spent a month at least every summer yachting in
the English Channel.</p>

<p>She had never known fear&mdash;never, at least, until
now. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;You
had better speak sharp, or I&rsquo;ll fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no reply, however, and the door continued
opening.</p>

<p>Had she seen anything, she doesn&rsquo;t think she would
have been so frightened, but there was nothing&mdash;absolutely
nothing visible. Her impressions were,
however, that something was coming out, and
that that something was nothing human.</p>

<p>It moved stealthily towards her&mdash;and she could
define a soft clinging tread, just as if it had tentacles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that kept adhering to the boards. She tried to
press the trigger of the revolver, but her muscles
refused to act, and when she opened her mouth
to shout she could not articulate a sound. It was
now close to her. One of its large, clammy feet
touched her, and she could feel its clammy, pungent
breath fanning the top of her head.</p>

<p>Then something icy cold and indescribably
repulsive sought her throat and slowly began to
throttle her. She tried to beat it off and to make
some kind of noise to attract help, but it was
all to no purpose. She was powerless. The grip
tightened. All the blood in her veins congealed&mdash;her
lungs expanded to the verge of bursting; and
then, when the pain and horror reached its climax,
and the identity of the hellish creature seemed about
to reveal itself, there was a loud crack, and with it
the acme of her sufferings, the final conscious stage
of excruciating asphyxiation passed, and she relapsed
into apparent death. She supposes that,
for the first time in her life, she must have fainted.
The crack was the report of her revolver. In her
acute agony, her fingers had closed convulsively
over the trigger, and the weapon had exploded.</p>

<p>The noise proved her salvation. No psychic
phenomena can stand violent vibration, and Sir
George Cookham, arriving on the scene at the sound
of the report, found his wife lying on the ground
unconscious, but alone. He heard her story, and
refused to be convinced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case of suggestion,&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;Lucy
was a highly strung, imaginative girl. She had, in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
probability, been reading spook tales, and hearing
a noise in the cupboard had at once attributed the
sound to ghosts. That was quite enough for
Wilkins. Servants are ready to believe anything&mdash;especially
if it is propagated by one of their
own class. Miss Dennis is a hypochondriac. All
governesses must be. The nature of their work
necessitates it. She heard a well-garnished account
of what was supposed to have happened from
Wilkins, probably from Lucy too, and the neurotic
state of her nerves did the rest. Of course when
it comes to you, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is more
difficult to understand. But as there are no such
things as ghosts&mdash;as they are a scientific impossibility&mdash;it
must have been suggestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain it was not,&rdquo; Lady Cookham retorted,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to leave the house and take
the children with me. It&rsquo;s not right for them to
stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir George protested, but Lady Cookham had
her own way, and in less than a fortnight there
were notices in the <cite>Field</cite>, and other papers, to say
that &ldquo;The Mayfields&rdquo; was to be let furnished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give it a year&rsquo;s trial,&rdquo; Lady Cookham
said, &ldquo;and, if the people who take it are not disturbed
by anything unusual happening, we will
conclude the hauntings are at an end and return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few days after this conversation Sir George
met Dr. Sickertorft on the platform of Coventry
Station. Though the day was almost sultry, the
doctor was muffled up in an overcoat, and appeared
very pale and thin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are leaving &lsquo;The Mayfields,&rsquo;&rdquo; Sickertorft
remarked. &ldquo;Has the ghost been too much
for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ghost!&rdquo; Sir George cried angrily, &ldquo;what the
deuce do you mean? We have let the house for
awhile, but not on account of any ghost. My wife
wants to be nearer London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the stories that have got afloat are
all moonshine,&rdquo; Sickertorft replied, with a
smile, &ldquo;and you are still just as sceptical as
ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Sir George responded; &ldquo;and if you hear
any more reports about &lsquo;The Mayfields&rsquo; being
haunted, kindly contradict them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sickertorft smiled. &ldquo;I will make a bet, Sir
George,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will be converted one
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may bet as much as you like, but you&rsquo;ll
lose,&rdquo; Sir George answered furiously. And turning
his back on Sickertorft, he walked away from him
without another word.</p>

<p>The following day Lady Cookham and the
children left, and Sir George finding himself the
sole occupant of the house, the servants having left
at midday, telephoned to Sydney N. Morgan, a
well-known private detective who specialised in
cases of theft and blackmail, asking him to come.
On his arrival at &ldquo;The Mayfields&rdquo; that same
evening, Morgan listened to all Sir George had to
say, and then made an exhaustive examination
of the premises, paying particular attention to the
cupboard in the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Sir George asked. &ldquo;What is your
opinion? Rats?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not human ones, at any rate,&rdquo; Morgan replied.
&ldquo;Anyhow, I can find no traces of them. I incline
to your theory of nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagination first and then suggestion.&rdquo; Sir
George grunted. Now that he was alone there
with the detective, he began to have misgivings.
The house seemed strangely large and silent. But
ghosts! Bah! There were no such things. He
said as much to Morgan, and they both laughed.</p>

<p>Then they stared at one another in amazement,
for, from afar off, there came an answering echo, a
faint yet distinctly audible&mdash;chuckle.</p>

<p>They were standing at one end of the corridor
on the ground floor when this happened, and to
both of them the sound seemed to emanate from
the cupboard. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Sir George
asked. &ldquo;The wind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may have been,&rdquo; Morgan said dubiously,
&ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no getting away from the fact that it
was a queer noise for the wind to make. I made
sure I looked everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go upstairs and get my revolver,&rdquo; Sir George
observed. &ldquo;It may come in handy. Will you
remain here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked at one another furtively, and each
thought they saw fear in the other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Both, however, had reputations to sustain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait down here, Sir George,&rdquo; Morgan said,
&ldquo;and keep an eye on the cupboard. You&rsquo;ll call
if you want me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Sir George replied. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be gone
more than a minute. Be on your guard. It&rsquo;s
just about this time the alleged disturbances begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hurried off, and Morgan watched his long legs
cross the hall and hastily ascend the main staircase.
The hall occupied a large space in the centre
of the house, and overlooking it was a gallery
connecting the east and west wings.</p>

<p>Sir George&rsquo;s room&mdash;that is to say, the room he
was reserving for himself on this occasion&mdash;was
in the east wing, the first to be reached from
the gallery, and Morgan could almost see it from
where he stood in the hall. His gaze was still
fixed on Sir George&rsquo;s retreating figure when a noise
from behind him made him turn hurriedly round,
and he distinctly saw the cupboard door open a
few inches. Moving towards the cupboard, he then
saw, as the door opened wider, a huge indefinable
something emerge from it. Morgan admits that the
most sublime terror seized him, and that he shrank
back convulsively against the wall, totally unable
to do anything but stare. The shape came towards
him with a slow, shambling gait, and Morgan was
at length able to compare it with an enormous
fungus. It had arms and legs truly, but they were
disproportionately long and crooked, and hardly
seemed to belong to the body.</p>

<p>There was no apparent head. The whole thing
was vague and misty, but suggestive of the greatest
foulness and antagonism. Morgan&rsquo;s horror was so
great as it passed him that he believes his heart
practically stopped beating, and so tightly had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
clenched his hands that the print of his finger nails
remained on his palms for days afterwards. It
left him in time, however, and he watched it shuffle
its unwholesome way across the hall and surreptitiously
begin to ascend the staircase.</p>

<p>He tried to shout to Sir George to put him on
his guard, but his voice refused to act and he could
do nothing.</p>

<p>Up and up it went, until at last it reached the
gallery and crept onward into the east wing.</p>

<p>He then heard Sir George cry out, &ldquo;Hullo,
Morgan! Is that you? Anything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; There
was then a moment of the most intense silence, and
then a shriek. Morgan says it was like a woman&rsquo;s
shriek&mdash;it was so shrill, so uncontrolled, so full of
the most abject terror. For a moment it completely
paralysed Morgan, but he seems then to
have partially recovered. Anyhow, he pulled himself
sufficiently together to run up the stairs and
arrive outside Sir George&rsquo;s door in time to hear
sounds of a most violent struggle. Tables, chairs,
washstand, crockery, were all hurled to the ground,
as Sir George raced round and round the room in
his desperate efforts to escape. Once he caught
hold of the handle of the door and turned it furiously.
&ldquo;Let me out!&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake
let me out!&rdquo; and again Morgan heard him rush to
the window and pound madly on the glass.</p>

<p>Then there came another spell of silence&mdash;short
and emphatic&mdash;then a shriek that far eclipsed
anything Morgan had hitherto heard, and then a
voice&mdash;a man&rsquo;s voice, but certainly not Sir George&rsquo;s&mdash;which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
speaking in sharp, jerky sentences that
conveyed with them a sense of strange far-offness,
said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll believe now, Sir George. You&rsquo;ll
believe now. Damn you, you&rsquo;ll believe now!&rdquo;
Then there were sounds as if someone was being
shaken very violently to and fro, and Morgan,
utterly unable to stand it any longer, turned tail
and&mdash;fled.</p>

<p class="dots">.<span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span></p>

<p>When Morgan returned some half an hour later,
accompanied by the lodge-keeper and one of the
under-gardeners, they found Sir George lying in a
heap on the floor&mdash;unconscious. He did not
die, however, neither did he go mad; but his heart
was badly affected, and he subsequently developed
fits.</p>

<p>Nothing would induce him to describe what had
actually taken place, and this, added to the fact
that he never again set foot within &ldquo;The Mayfields,&rdquo;
caused his friends to draw their own conclusions.
Morgan told me all about it, and I at once wrote
to Dr. Sickertorft. I was too late, however; Dr.
Sickertorft had been dead some weeks&mdash;he had died
of cerebral tuberculosis exactly three months after
Morgan&rsquo;s visit to &ldquo;The Mayfields.&rdquo; I was informed
that he attributed the fatal malady to supernormal
concentration.</p>

<br />
THE EMPTY LEASH<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">A CASE OF HAUNTING IN ST. JOHN&rsquo;S WOOD</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> so often been accused of writing too exclusively
about the horrid types of spirit, such as
earth-bound murderers, suicides, and elements, that
I am more than pleased to be able to present to my
readers a case of a different kind. Until quite
recently Barcombe House, St. John&rsquo;s Wood, was
haunted by the ghost of a very lovely little girl,
who, it is believed, died of a broken heart because
a dog to which she was very much attached had
to be destroyed. I obtained particulars as to the
hauntings from a Mr. John Tyley, whose verbatim
account I will endeavour, as nearly as possible, to
reproduce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guy Darnton is a very intimate friend of mine.
Some people call us inseparables, and I suppose we
are&mdash;though at times, I believe, no two men could
so thoroughly hate one another. Indeed, to such
an extremity has this spirit of execration and dislike
been carried that I have on occasions actually
accused him of being my very worst&mdash;my most
cruel, and certainly my most subtly destructive&mdash;enemy.
But even then, even at the moment when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
my abhorrence of him has been most acute, I have
always accorded him&mdash;reluctantly, I admit&mdash;one
great redeeming quality&mdash;his affection for and
kindness to Ghoul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ghoul was an Irish terrier, just an ordinary-looking
Irish terrier, with all the pugnacious and&mdash;as
some unkind critics would add&mdash;quarrelsome
characteristics of his race. He hated fops, those
little brown Pekinese and King Charles horrors that
ladies scent and comb, and stuff to bursting-point
with every imaginable dainty; and whenever he
saw one mincing its way along the street, he would
always block its path and try to bite it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet he was an idealist. It&rsquo;s all nonsense to
say that animals have no appreciation of beauty.
Ghoul had. He was fond of biscuits truly; but he
liked other things more, far more than food. I
have known him stand in front of a rose bush and
gaze at it with an expression which no one but the
most unkind and prejudiced sceptic could possibly
misinterpret for anything but sheer, solid admiration;
and I used to notice that whenever he was
introduced to several ladies, he always wagged his
tail hardest at the prettiest of them. But most of
all Ghoul admired pretty children&mdash;dainty little
girls with fluffy yellow curls and big, smiling eyes.
He adored them, and he hated with equal fervour
all children who were in any way physically ill-favoured.
I have known him bark furiously at a
boy who squinted, and snarl at and refuse to go near
a girl who had a blotchy, yellow complexion and a
cavernous, frog-shaped mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am speaking as if Ghoul were my property.
He was not&mdash;at least, not in the legal sense.
Darnton paid for his licence&mdash;and housed and fed
him&mdash;and so had every apparent right to call
himself Ghoul&rsquo;s master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In spite of this, however, I knew intuitively
that Ghoul regarded me as his actual master, and
I believe the explanation of this circumstance lay
in the superphysical. I am psychic, and I am
convinced that the unknown is nearer, far nearer
to me than it is to most people. Now dogs, at
least most dogs, have the faculty of second sight,
of clairvoyance and clairaudience, very acutely
developed&mdash;you have only to be in a haunted
house with them to see it; and there is nothing
they stand in awe of more&mdash;or for which they have
a more profound respect&mdash;than the superphysical.
Now Ghoul was no exception. He saw around me
what I only felt; and he recognised that I was the
magnet. He respected me as one true psychic
respects another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day we were out together. Darnton had
gone to the dentist, and Ghoul, tired of his own
company, resolved to pay me a visit. He wandered
in at the wicket gate of my garden just as I was about
to set off for a morning constitutional. I greeted
him somewhat boisterously, for Ghoul, when extra
solemn, always excited my risibility, and, after a
brief skirmish with him on behalf of my cat, an
extraordinarily ugly Tom, for whom Ghoul cherished
the most inveterate hatred, we set off together. It
was pure accident that led me into the Adelaide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Road. I was half-way along it, thinking of nothing
in particular, when someone whistled behind me,
and I turned round. As a rule, one may see a few
pedestrians&mdash;one or two at least&mdash;at all times of
the day in the Adelaide Road, but oddly enough
no one was in sight just at that moment, and I
could see no traces of Ghoul. I called him, and
getting no reply, walked back a little distance.
At last I discovered him. He was in the front
garden of Barcombe House, sitting in the centre of
a grass plot, his eyes fixed on space, but with such
an expression of absorbing interest that I was absolutely
astounded. Thinking something, perhaps,
was hiding in the bushes, I threw stones and made
a great shooing; but nothing came out, and Ghoul
still maintained his position. The look in his face
did not suggest anything antagonistic, it was indicative
rather of something very pleasing to him&mdash;something
idealistic&mdash;something he adored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouted &lsquo;Ghoul!&rsquo; He did not take the
slightest notice, and when I caught him by the
scruff of the neck, he dug his paws in the ground
and whined piteously. Then I grew alarmed. He
must either have hurt himself or have gone mad.
I examined him carefully, and nothing appearing
to be the matter with him, I lifted him up, and,
despite his frantic struggles, carried him out of the
garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The moment I set him down he raced back.
Then I grew determined. A taxi was hailed, and
Ghoul, driven off in it, speedily found himself a close
prisoner in Darnton&rsquo;s exceedingly unromantic study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That afternoon I revisited Barcombe House
alone. The premises were to let, and, judging by
their neglected and dilapidated appearance, had
been so for some considerable time. Both front
and back garden were overgrown with a wild profusion
of convolvulus, thistles, and other weeds;
and an air of desolation, common to all abandoned
houses, hung about the place. All the same, I could
detect nothing unpleasant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was unmistakably aware of some superphysical
influence; but that influence, unlike the
majority of those I had hitherto experienced, was
decidedly attractive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed to affect everything&mdash;the ruddy
rays of sunlight that, falling aslant the paths,
turned them into scintillating gold; the buttercups
and dandelions more glorious yellow than I had
ever remembered seeing them; the air&mdash;charged
to overflowing with the rich, entrancing perfume
of an abnormally generous summer&rsquo;s choicest
flowers. All nature here seemed stimulated,
cheered and glorified, and the longer I lingered
the longer I wished to linger. At the far end of the
garden was an arbour overgrown with jasmine and
sweet honeysuckle, and on its moss-covered seat
I espied a monstrous Teddy bear adorned with a
piece of faded and mildewy pink ribbon. The
sight filled me with a strange melancholy. The
poor Teddy bear, once held so lovingly in the tight
embrace of two little infantile arms, was now abandoned
to the mercies of spiders and wood-lice, and
the pitiless spoliation of decay. How long had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
been left, and where was its owner? I looked at
the sunshine, and, in the beams that gilded everything
around me, I felt an answer to my queries.
Most haunted places scare me, but it was otherwise
here; and I was so fascinated, so eager to probe
the mystery to its core, that I left the garden and,
crossing a tiny stone yard, approached the back of
the house. The premises were quite easy of access,
as the catch of one of the windows was broken, and
the shutter of the coal-house had come off its hinges.
One has always supposed that the basement of any
house that has stood empty for a long time must
become cold and musty, but here I could detect
neither cold nor mustiness. Even in the darkest
recesses the sun made its influence felt, and its
beams warmed and illuminated walls and flagstones
alike. I now entered a large and lofty apartment,
with a daintily tiled floor, spotlessly clean ceiling,
artistically coloured walls, and scrupulously clean
dresser. Here again the devastating hand of decay
was nowhere to be seen, and indeed I thought I
had never been in such a pleasant kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intended waiting there only until I had consumed
a sandwich, but when I rose to go, something
held me back, and I tarried on and on, until
the evening set in and dark and strangely formed
shadows began to dim the walls and floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I was mounting the stairs to explore the
upper premises a gentle gust of wind blew in my
face and filled my nostrils with the most delightful
odour of &lsquo;cherry-pie.&rsquo; Intoxicated, I halted, and,
leaning against the banisters, inhaled the perfume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to the full extent of my lungs. Then I listened.
The breeze rustling past me down the stairs rattled
the window panes and jarred the doors, and seemed
to disseminate, in its wake, new and even more perplexing
shadows. Presently a door slammed, and
I distinctly heard footsteps cross the hall and begin
to ascend the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was now for the first time that terror laid
hold of me, but the fascination of it was so compelling
that I lowered my head over the balustrade
to listen. I tried to reason the thing out. Why, I
asked myself, should these footsteps alarm me?
What was it that made them different from other
footsteps? Surely there was no difference. And
yet, if that were so, why was I certain that they
were not the footsteps of any trespasser from outside?
I debated earnestly, desperately, but could
arrive at no other conclusion than that there was a
difference, and that this difference did not lie in
the sounds themselves, but in the sense of atmosphere
they conveyed, an atmosphere that was
peculiarly subtle and quite incompatible with the
natural. At last I knew for certain that the sounds
were superphysical, and yet such was my dread
of the Unknown that I fought most frantically
against my convictions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The steps had, by this time, so I calculated,
reached the first landing, and I now noticed in
them a cautiousness that I had not remarked
before. What should I see? There was still
time for flight, but whither could I go? Behind
me were a row of half-open doors, through which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the sun, sinking fast, shone its last rays. The
effect&mdash;a sad one&mdash;forcibly reminded me of the
end of all things&mdash;death; and the sadness of it
harmonised well with an air of silent expectation
that seemed suddenly to have filled the whole
house. My fears grew. I was certain that the
oncoming footsteps could only emanate from a
phantom of the most startling and terrifying
description, and I bitterly repented of my rashness
in coming to the house alone. With a supreme
effort, I averted my gaze and turned to seek refuge
in one mad headlong plunge, should there be no
other haven, through a window; but the power
to do so was denied me. I was paralysed. The
steps came nearer, and now, some distance below
me, moving rapidly up the staircase, came something
bright. I watched it pass swiftly round
one bend, and then another, and at the moment
my suspense had reached its limit and I felt I
was on the border-line of either death or insanity, it
turned the last corner and shot fully into view.
The reaction was then so great that I reeled back
against the wall and burst out laughing. Instead
of some distorted semblance of humanity, instead
of some grotesque, semi-animal elemental, something
too grim and devilish for the mind to conceive
and survive, I saw&mdash;a child: a girl of about twelve,
dressed in the most becoming frock of soft white
satin, high in the waist, and from thence falling in
folds to her feet. She had long bright golden hair
hanging in loose curls on either side of her low white
forehead; delicately pencilled eyebrows that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
slightly knit, and wide open blue-grey eyes that
were fixed on me with an expression of the gravest
anxiety, mingled with a something enigmatical,
something sorely puzzling and with which I seemed
to be familiar. Again and again I have tried to
diagnose it, and at times the solution has seemed
very near; but it has always eluded me in the
end, and the mystery is still as great and as poignant
as ever. The child held a leash in one hand, whilst
she stretched out the other confidingly towards me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always a worshipper of beauty, I was stooping
down to kiss her little hand, when, to my consternation,
she abruptly vanished, and I found
myself standing there&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An intense sadness now seized me, and throwing
myself on the floor I gave way to an attack of utter
dejection. The vision I had just seen was in very
deed the embodiment of all my boyhood&rsquo;s dreams,
and for the moment, but only for the moment, my
old self, a little pensive boy adoring heart and soul
a girl&rsquo;s fair face, had lived again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all too cruelly brief; for with the
vision my old ego vanished too; and I felt&mdash;I
knew it had been wrested from me and hurried
to some far-off place where the like of my present
self could not be admitted. I rose at length
chilled and hopeless, and tearing myself away from
the landing with a desperate effort, wandered home.
I could not rest. An intense dissatisfaction with
myself, with my whole mode of life, my surroundings,
obsessed me. I longed to alter, to become
something different, something unsophisticated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
simple, even elementary. This change in me
brought me into closer sympathy with Ghoul, who,
as I have said, was strangely altered himself. He
avoided Darnton with the most marked persistence,
and was always hovering round my doorstep and
lying on the lawn. At last one day I could stand
it no longer. &lsquo;Ghoul,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the same yearning
possesses us both. It&rsquo;s the child&mdash;the child with
the lovely eyes. We must see her. You and I
are rivals, old fellow. But never mind! We&rsquo;ll
visit the house together and let her take her choice.
Come along!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ghoul&rsquo;s joy on entering the garden of Barcombe
House knew no bounds. He tore in at the
gate, capered across the grass, barked, whined,
wagged his tail furiously, and behaved like the
veriest of lunatics. Gaining admittance into the
house as easily as before, I quickly made my way
to the third-floor landing, Ghoul darting up the
stairs ahead of me. Without a moment&rsquo;s pause he
bolted into a room immediately in front of us, and
springing on to the sill of a large casement window
that was wide open, peered eagerly out, exhibiting,
as he did so, the wildest manifestation of excitement.
Following the direction of his eyes, I looked down
into the garden, and there, gazing up at us, her
curls shining gold in the hot summer sun, stood
the little ghost. The moment she saw me, she
smiled, and, moving forward with a peculiar gliding
motion, entered the house. Once again a door
slammed, and, once again, there came the patter
of ascending footsteps. Ghoul ran to meet her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
She stooped over him, patted his head and fastened
the leash to his collar, whilst I, merely a spectator,
felt the bitterest pangs of jealousy. Then she
looked up, and instantly the joy in her face was
converted into pity&mdash;pity for me. Without a
doubt Ghoul had triumphed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still patting him on the head and urging him
forward, she ran past me, and, mounting the window
sill, glanced round at me with a mischievous smile.
Even then I did not comprehend the full significance
of her action. I merely stood and stared&mdash;stared
as if I would never grow tired of staring,
so fascinated was I by the piquante beauty of that
superhuman little face. I was still staring when
she put one foot through the open window; still
staring when the other foot followed; still staring
when she waved her hand gleefully at me and
sprang out&mdash;out into the sunny brightness of the
hot summer noon. I thought of Ghoul. He had
sprung, too. Sprung barking and whining with a
joy unequalled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ran to look for him. He lay where he had
fallen, his neck broken and his spirit fled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darnton, of course, would not believe me.
We had a stormy interview, and we have never
spoken to one another since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house&mdash;Barcombe House&mdash;is now let, and
the occupants inform me that they have never
once been troubled&mdash;at least not by ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
THE DRESSING-ROOM<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">CASES OF HAUNTINGS AT THE PRINCE REGENT
AND OTHER THEATRES</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> idea of a theatre being haunted&mdash;a theatre
where everything is bright and everyone full of
life&mdash;must, for the moment, strike one as preposterous.
Why, the mere thought of the footlights,
to say nothing of the clapping of hands
and thunders of applause from the Gods, conjures
up a picture which is the very antithesis of ghosts.
Besides, why should a theatre be haunted? To be
haunted, a place must have a history&mdash;someone
must have committed a crime there, such as murder
or suicide; and surely no such thing has ever
happened in a theatre! Imagine a murder, a real
one, at Drury Lane, or a suicide, say, at the Gaiety!
Why, the thing is monstrous, absurd! And as to a
ghost&mdash;a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> ghost&mdash;appearing on the stage
or in the auditorium, why, such an idea is without
rhyme or reason; it is, in fact, inconceivable, and
the public&mdash;the all-wise public&mdash;would, of course,
laugh it to scorn.</p>

<p>But stop a moment. Does the general public
know everything? Is not the theatre, to it, simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the stage, and is it not profoundly ignorant of all
that lies beyond the stage&mdash;away back, behind the
hidden wings? Is it not profoundly ignorant,
also, of the great basement below the stage with its
dark and tortuous passages; and profoundly
ignorant of the many flights of cold and carpetless
stairs, leading to story upon story of seemingly
never-ending dressing-rooms and corridors? What
does it know, too, of the individual lives of the
many generations of actors and actresses, call-boys
and dressers who have toiled wearily up those
stairs and along those dimly lit passages in between
the acts? what does it know of the thoughts of all
that host of bygones&mdash;of their terrible anxieties,
their loves, their passions? what does it know of
the tragedies with which, doubtless, many of these
people have been intimately associated, and of the
crowd of ghosts they have, wittingly or unwittingly,
brought with them from their own homes?&mdash;for
ghosts, even as they haunt houses, haunt people
and mercilessly attach themselves to them. Moreover,
although they have long since been forgotten,
tragedies have occurred in some of the oldest of the
London theatres. Hunt up the records of eighty
and ninety years ago, and you will find that more
than one dressing-room witnessed the tragic ending
of some lesser star, some member of the crowd, a
mere &ldquo;walker on&rdquo;; that duels were not infrequently
fought in grim earnest on the boards; and that more
than one poor super has been found hanging from
a cobwebby beam in a remote corner of the great
maze-like basement of the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, think of the site of a London theatre!
Prehistoric man or beast may well lie buried there;
witches accused of practising their nefarious rites
on or near that site may well have been burnt there.</p>

<p>Think, too, of the houses that once may have
stood there! Inns, with dark tell-tale stains on
their boards; taverns, tainted with vice&mdash;the
rendezvous of truculent swashbucklers and painted
jades; and even more terrible still, cruel and
ghastly slaughter-houses.</p>

<p>Ground, then, and houses alike, all may have had
their hauntings; and the ghosts may have stayed
on, as ghosts often do, haunting anew each successive
building. Yes, more than one London theatre is
haunted&mdash;and several of these theatres have more
than one ghost.</p>

<p>The proprietors affect ignorance and of course
tell you nothing. They like to see long queues
of people waiting for admission to their show, but
they have no desire to see a corresponding crowd
at the box office seeking permission to sit up all
night in the theatre to see the ghost. No, if you
want to find out if a theatre is haunted, you must
not apply to the proprietor, you must inquire of
the actors themselves; and, in order to stand a
really good chance of discovering the truth, you
should, if possible, for a time become one of them.
It was for the purpose of making such a discovery
that I took it into my head one day last year to
apply for a walk on at the Mercury. I had often
wondered if the Mercury was haunted. I speedily
found out that it was not. Still, I was not altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
disappointed, for I learned from some of my fellow-walkers
on and from one of the stage hands of
several very interesting cases of hauntings at other
of the London theatres. There is the Prince
Regent&rsquo;s, for instance, which, as recently as the
late nineties had a dressing-room, 25, that was always
kept locked. It was in the autumn of 1897 that
John W. Mayhewe was engaged to play a small
but rather important part there in <cite>The Merciful
Pirate</cite>. The cast was an unusually large one, and
Mayhewe discovered that he had to share dressing-room
25 with another actor called Talbotson. The
opening night of the play, however, Talbotson
was laid up with influenza, and Mayhewe had room
25 to himself. Being one of those over-anxious
people who err on the side of being ultra-punctual,
he arrived at the theatre at least an hour before the
curtain went up, and, on the way to his room, he
paused to chat with the stage doorkeeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I noticed,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;when I was dressing
for rehearsal yesterday that my room smelt very
musty. Isn&rsquo;t it often used?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been used since I&rsquo;ve been here,&rdquo; was
the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Mayhewe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; the doorkeeper answered
surlily. &ldquo;If you want to know, you had better
ask the stage manager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not caring to do this, Mayhewe made no further
remarks, but hastened upstairs. No one was about,
and the noise of his footsteps sounded strangely
loud in the silent emptiness of the passages. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
entered his room at last, hung his coat and hat
on the door, and, crossing to his seat in front of a
small mirror, sat down. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said to
himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Talbotson won&rsquo;t be here to-night.
I&rsquo;m not in a mood for talking, and the
fellow bores me to distraction.&rdquo; He lit a cigarette,
leaned back in a more comfortable attitude, and
for some minutes allowed himself to revel in the
luxury of a perfectly blank state of mind. Suddenly
the handle of the door turned&mdash;a solitary, isolated
sound&mdash;and he sat up sharply in his chair. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
there?&rdquo; he shouted. There was no response.
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have latched it properly,&rdquo; he reasoned,
and once again he leaned back in his chair and
smoked. Five or six minutes passed in this fashion,
and he was thinking of beginning to dress, when
there was another noise. Something behind him
fell on the floor with a loud flop.</p>

<p>Once again he turned swiftly round. It was
his hat&mdash;a hard felt bowler. It had fallen from the
door peg on which he had hung it, and was still
feebly oscillating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is curious how one sometimes notices all
these little things,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;I dare say
door handles have turned and hats have fallen
a thousand times when I might have heard them
and haven&rsquo;t. I suppose it is because everything
is so very quiet and I&rsquo;m alone in this part of the
building.&rdquo; Then he glanced at his coat&mdash;a long,
double-breasted ulster&mdash;and rubbed his eyes
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what a
curious shape the thing has taken! It&rsquo;s swelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
out just as if someone were inside it. Or has my
eyesight suddenly gone wrong?&rdquo; He leaned
forward and examined it closely. No. He was
not mistaken. The coat was no longer untenanted.
There was something inside it&mdash;something which
filled it like he had done; but it was something
to which he could ascribe no name. He could see
it there, and mentally feel that it was peering at
him with eyes full of the most jibing mockery and
hate; but he could not define it. It was something
quite outside his ken, something with which he had
had no previous acquaintance. He tried to whistle
and appear nonchalant, but it was of no avail. The
coat&mdash;his coat&mdash;had something in it, and that
something was staring back at him. What a fool he
had been to come so early. At last, with a supreme
effort, he took his eyes from the door, and, swinging
round in his chair, resumed smoking. He sat thus
for some moments, and then a board close behind
him creaked.</p>

<p>Of course there is nothing in a creak&mdash;boards
and furniture are always creaking, and most people
attribute the creaking to a change in the temperature.
So did Mayhewe. &ldquo;The room is beginning
to get warm&mdash;the gas has heated it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that
is why.&rdquo; Still he gradually lowered his eyes, and
when they rested on the mirror in front of him, he
gave the barest suspicion of a start. In the mirror
were reflected the door and the coat, but the latter
hung quite limply now. There was nothing whatever
filling it out.</p>

<p>What in Heaven&rsquo;s name had become of the thing?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Where had it got to? Close beside Mayhewe was
the grate, and a sudden rustling in it, followed by
a hurried descent of soot, made him laugh outright.
The explanation was now so very simple. The
wind was responsible for it all&mdash;for the door handle,
the hat, the coat, and the creak. How truly
ridiculous! He would dress. With that object
in view he threw the end of his cigarette in the
fender and, rising, was about to quit his seat, when
his eyes fell on his gloves. He had thrown them
quite carelessly on the wash-stand, almost
immediately in front of him, and he had noticed
nothing remarkable about them then. But now&mdash;surely
it could not be the wind this time; there
were hands in them, and these hands were strangely
unlike his own. Whereas his fingers had blunt,
spatulate tips, the tops of these fingers were curved
and pointed like the talons of some cruel beast of
prey, and the palms were much longer and narrower
than his own. He stared at them, too fascinated
to do otherwise, and it seemed to him that they
shifted their position and came nearer to him,
with a slow, stealthy, silent motion, like that of
some monstrous spider creeping murderously towards
its helpless victim. He watched them for
some moments quite motionless, and then, yielding
to a sudden fit of ungovernable fury, he threw his
tobacco pouch at the nearest.</p>

<p>It rolled convulsively over on its back after the
manner of some living stricken creature, and then,
gradually reassuming its shape, stealthily began
once more to approach him. At last his nerves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
could stand it no longer. A demoniacal passion
to smash, burn, torture it seized him, and, springing
to his feet, he picked up his chair, and, swinging it
round his head, brought it down with the utmost
frenzy on the wash-stand. He was looking at his
handiwork&mdash;the broken china, chair legs, and gas
shade&mdash;when the door of his room opened and the
call-boy timidly entered.</p>

<p>Mayhewe kept the stage waiting some minutes
that night, but the management did not abuse him
nearly so violently as he had anticipated, and the
next evening he was allotted another room.</p>

<p>Then it transpired, leaked out through one of the
old supers who had worked at the theatre for years,
that room 25 had always borne the name of being
haunted, and that, excepting in circumstances such
as the present, it had invariably been kept locked.
Some two years ago, according to the old super,
when just such another emergency had occurred
and the room had been used, the same thing had
happened: the gentleman who had been put there
had been seized with a sudden fit of madness, and
had broken everything he could lay hands on;
and some time before that a similar experience had
befallen an actress who had unavoidably&mdash;there
being no other room available&mdash;occupied room
25.</p>

<p>Now had Mayhewe not heard of these two cases,
he might have concluded, in spite of feeling sure
that he had been in a normal state of mind upon
entering the room, that what he had gone through
was due merely to an over-excited imagination;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
but since he now knew that others had witnessed
the same phenomena, he saw no reason to doubt
that there was some peculiarly sinister influence
attached to the room. As to the cause of the
haunting, he could elicit nothing more authentic
or definite than the somewhat vague recollections
of a very old actor. According to this rather
doubtful authority, shortly after the opening of the
theatre, one of the performers had suddenly developed
madness and had been confined in room 25
till a suitable escort had been found to take him
to an asylum. It was the only tragic occurrence,
he asserted, that had ever taken place in that
theatre. Now, supposing this to be true&mdash;that a
madman really had been conducted from the
stage to room 25 and temporarily confined there&mdash;might
one not reasonably believe that in this
incident lay the origin of the hauntings? It was in
this room, in all probability, that the outbreak of
madness passed its most acute stage&mdash;that psychological
stage when the rational ego makes its last
desperate stand against the overwhelming assault
of a new and diseased self. And again&mdash;supposing
this incident to be a fact&mdash;what more likely than
that the immaterial insane ego of the afflicted man
would, at times, separate itself from his material
body and revisit the scene of its terrible conflict,
permanently taking up its abode there after its
material body had passed away? This theory&mdash;a
very possible one, to my mind&mdash;would have strong
support from parallel cases, for half the most
malignant forms of haunting are directly traceable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to the earth-bound spirits of the insane. There are
several houses within a short walking distance
of Bond Street that were once the temporary
homes of mentally afflicted people, and they are
now haunted in a more or less similar manner to
room 25.</p>

<p>If this story of the old actor&rsquo;s is not correct&mdash;if
his memory played him false&mdash;then of course one
must look around for some other solution; and as,
apparently, there is no history attached to the
Prince Regent Theatre itself, one must assume
either that the site of the theatre was haunted prior
to the erection of the present building; or that the
ghost was originally attached to some person who
once occupied room 25, and that it subsequently
left that person and remained in the room; or
that some article of furniture in room 25, possibly
even a fixture, was imported there from some badly
haunted locality. There is, indeed, evidence regarding
the first point; evidence that, either on or
close to the site of the theatre, the remains of prehistoric
animals&mdash;animals of a singularly savage
species, which makes it more than likely that they
met with a violent death&mdash;were unearthed; and as
ghostly phenomena in the form of animals are quite
as common as ghostly phenomena in the form of
human beings, the hauntings of room 25 may very
possibly be due to the spirit of one or more of these
creatures. Or again, they might be caused by
what is generally known as a Vice Elemental, or
&ldquo;Neutrarian&rdquo;; that is to say, a spirit that has
never inhabited a material body, but which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
wholly hostile to the human species. Such spirits
are often, I believe, drawn to certain spots by the
lustful or malicious thoughts of individuals, and
this might well be the case at the Prince Regent&rsquo;s
Theatre.</p>

<p class="dots">.<span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span></p>

<p>It was also during my engagement at the
Mercury that I heard of a haunting at the Lombard.
This theatre, it appears, has a ghostly visitant in
the form of a particularly malevolent-looking
clown.</p>

<p>According to one report, a lady and her daughter&mdash;Mrs.
and Miss Dawkins&mdash;occupied box 3 one
January night during the run of an exceedingly
pretty modern version of <cite>Cinderella</cite>.</p>

<p>The lights were down and all eyes were focused
on Cinderella, one of the prettiest and daintiest
little actresses in London, dressed in pink and sitting
before a very realistic make-belief of a kitchen fire,
when Miss Dawkins, who had her elbows resting
on the balustrade and was leaning well forward,
heard a faint ejaculation from close beside her.
Fearing lest her mother was ill, she turned sharply
round, and was somewhat surprised to see that Mrs.
Dawkins had left her seat and was leaning against
the wall of the box with her arms folded and a
most satirical smile on her face. Both the attitude
and the expression were so entirely novel that Miss
Dawkins could only conclude that her mother
had suddenly taken leave of her senses; and she
was deliberating what to do, when a feeling that a
sudden metamorphosis was about to take place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
held her spellbound. Bit by bit her mother seemed
to fade away, to melt into the background; the
dim outline and the general posture remained, but
instead of the actual body and well-known face,
she saw something else gradually begin to form
and to usurp their place. Her mother had very
delicate and beautifully shaped hands, but these
vanished, and the hands Miss Dawkins now looked
on were large and red and coarse&mdash;horribly coarse.
Fearful of what she might see next, but totally
unable to fight against some strange, controlling
agency, she continued to look. First, her eyes
rested on a pair of sleeves&mdash;white, baggy, and
soiled; then on a broad, deep chest, also clad in
white and decorated in the most fantastic manner
conceivable in the centre; then on a short, immensely
thick neck; and then on the face. The
shock she now received was acute. Instinct had
prepared her for something very startling, but for
nothing quite so grotesque, nor so wholly at variance
with the general atmosphere of the theatre. It
was the painted, crinkled face of a clown&mdash;not a
merry, jesting grimaldi, but a clown of a different
type&mdash;a clown without a smile&mdash;a clown born and
fully trained to his business in Hell. As he stood
there glaring at the footlights, every feature, every
atom of his person breathed out hate&mdash;hate of a
nature so noxious and intense that it seemed to Miss
Dawkins as if the very air were poisoned by it.
Being a devout Catholic, she at once crossed herself
and, although almost powerless with horror, began
to pray. The face then faded till it entirely disappeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and Miss Dawkins once again found
herself gazing upon the well-known countenance
of her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you standing?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mrs. Dawkins replied.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like this box. I think there is something
very unpleasant about it. I haven&rsquo;t been
myself for the last few minutes. When I was
sitting by you just now, I suddenly became obsessed
with a bitter hatred against everyone on the
stage. The very sight of them maddened me. It
seemed to me I had met them all in a former existence
and that they had done me some irreparable
injury. I got up and began to plot how I could
best get even with them. Then the idea of setting
fire to the theatre seized me. I had clear visions
of a small, dimly lighted room, with which I was
strangely familiar, down below the stage in a dark,
draughty basement. I knew every inch of the
place as if I had lived there all my life. &lsquo;I will go
there,&rsquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;and apply a match. If
anyone sees me, no one will suspect. They will only
say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s old Tom. He didn&rsquo;t get the chuck
after all. He&rsquo;s come back.&rdquo;&rsquo; I was repeating the
words &lsquo;It&rsquo;s old Tom,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Fire,&rsquo; when something
seemed to strike me very forcibly on the forehead.
This caused me the greatest agony for a moment.
Then you spoke, and I was myself again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to go home?&rdquo; Miss Dawkins
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I would,&rdquo; was the response. And they
went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Subsequently, a few judicious inquiries elicited
no little light on the matter.</p>

<p>Many years before, an old actor, called Tom
Weston, had been employed annually in pantomime
at the Lombard as clown. Like so many
of his profession, however, particularly the older
ones, he took to drink; and he was so often intoxicated
on the stage that the management were
at last obliged to dismiss him. He took his dismissal
very badly, and one night, having gone to the
theatre in disguise, he was discovered in the act of
setting fire to a room immediately beneath the
stage. In consideration for his many years&rsquo; service
and age, the management did not prosecute, but
recommended his friends to keep him under close
supervision. Tom, however, very soon ceased to
cause the management any anxiety, for, two days
after he had attempted, in so diabolical a manner,
to wreak his vengeance on all who had been associated
with him at the theatre, he shot himself dead
in his own home. But on every anniversary of his
death, so it is affirmed, he is either seen or heard,
or his presence is in some way demonstrated, in
box 3 of the Lombard Theatre. That his spirit
should frequent that particular spot in the theatre
seems to be a fact for which no reason can be
assigned.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a><span class="g">CHAPTER VI</span><br />
<br />
THE RETICULE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> Norwich and Swaffham, low down in a
little valley, there once stood a mill. It is now a
ruin, and all the people round studiously avoid it
after nightfall. It must be admitted that they
have some reason for doing so in view of the incidents
I am about to relate.</p>

<p>Some years ago on an early autumn afternoon two
ladies, Miss Smith and Miss Raven, fashion designers
to the firm of Kirsome &amp; Gooting, Sloane
Street, London, set out from Norwich for a tramp
into the country. Both girls&mdash;for they were only
girls&mdash;were typically modern; that is to say, they
were bonny and athletic, and, despite the sedentary
nature of their vocation, extremely fond of outdoor
life. Miss Raven, the elder of the two, was
nice-looking without perhaps being actually pretty;
but Miss Smith was undeniably a beauty. Had
she been a lady of title or an actress, all the society
papers would have been full of her. She did not,
however, crave for notoriety; she was quite content
with the homage of most of the young men
whom she knew, and the unspoken admiration
of many men whom she did not know, but who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
looked at her out of doors or sat near to her in
theatres and restaurants.</p>

<p>She was much attached to Miss Raven, and as
the two strode along, swinging their arms, their
tongues wagged merrily and without intermission.
On and on, down one hill and up another, past wood
and brook and hamlet they went, till a gradual
fading of the light warned them it was about time to
think of turning back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go as far as that old ruin,&rdquo; Miss Raven
said, pointing to a tumble-down white building
that nestled close to a winding stream. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never seen anything quite so picturesque.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve never seen anything quite so weird,&rdquo;
Miss Smith replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure I like it.
Besides, I&rsquo;m desperately thirsty. I want my tea.
We&rsquo;d much better go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had an argument, and it was eventually
agreed that they should go on&mdash;but not beyond
a certain point. &ldquo;Not an inch farther, mind,&rdquo;
Miss Smith said, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll turn back and leave you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ruin lay in a hollow, and as the two girls
descended the slope leading to it, a mist rose from
the ground as if to greet them. They quickened
their steps, and, approaching nearer, perceived a
mill wheel&mdash;the barest skeleton, crowned with
moss and ferns and dripping with slime. The pool
into which it dripped was overgrown in places with
reeds and chickweed, but was singularly bare and
black in the centre, and suggestive of very great
depth. Weeping willows bordered the stream,
and their sloping, stunted forms were gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
growing more and more indistinct in the oncoming
mist.</p>

<p>The space in front of the house, once, no doubt,
a prettily cultivated garden, was now full of rank
grass and weeds, and dotted here and there with
unsightly mounds consisting of fallen bricks and
mortar. Some of these mounds, long, low, and
narrow, were unpleasantly suggestive of graves,
whilst the atmosphere of the place, the leaden-hued
and mystic atmosphere, charged to the utmost
with the smell of decayed trees and mouldy walls,
might well have been that of an ancient churchyard.</p>

<p>A sense of insufferable gloom, utterly different
from any they had ever before experienced, took
possession of the two girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This place depresses me horribly. I don&rsquo;t know
when I&rsquo;ve felt so sad,&rdquo; Miss Smith observed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
very stupid of me, I know, but I can&rsquo;t help thinking
some great tragedy must have taken place here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel rather like that too,&rdquo; Miss Raven responded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen such dreariness. Do
you see those shadows on the water? How strange
they are! There&rsquo;s nothing that I can see to account
for them. There&rsquo;s certainly nothing the least like
them in the sedge. Besides, there oughtn&rsquo;t to be
any shadows there. There are none anywhere
else. Look! Oh, do look! They are changing.
They are completely different now. See, I&rsquo;ll throw
a stone at them.&rdquo; Her throw, missing its mark,
was so characteristically girlish that Miss Smith,
despite her leanings to suffragism, laughed. Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Raven threw again, and this time a deep plomb
announced her success. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she cried
triumphantly. &ldquo;Now do you see it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see something,&rdquo; Miss Smith answered. Then,
with sudden eagerness: &ldquo;Yes, you are right. The
shadows are continually changing. They seem to
separate themselves from the sedge, and fall like
live things into the pool. By the way, the pool
seems to be growing darker and bigger. I don&rsquo;t
like the place at all. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake let&rsquo;s get
away from it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Raven, however, was too fascinated. Stepping
carefully, so as to avoid the mud and long grass,
she went right up to the pool and peered into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How fearfully deep and still it is,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;What a beastly place to end one&rsquo;s days in.&rdquo;
Then she gave a sudden cry. &ldquo;Aileen! Here!
Come here, quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Smith hastened up to her. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;How you frightened me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Raven pointed excitedly at the water. It
was no longer tranquil. The chickweed round the
edges began to oscillate, white bubbles formed in the
centre, and then, quite suddenly, the entire surface
became a seething, hissing, rushing, roaring whirlpool,
which commenced rising in the most hideous
and menacing manner. Seizing Miss Raven by the
arm, Miss Smith dragged her back, and the two
fled in terror. The fog, however, was so thick that
they missed their way. They failed to strike
the road, and, instead, found themselves plunging
deeper and deeper into a fearful quagmire of mud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and the rankest compound of rushes, weeds, and
grass.</p>

<p>They were just despairing of ever extricating
themselves when Miss Smith felt a light tap on her
shoulder, and swinging round, was almost startled
out of her senses at the sight of a very white face
glaring at her. Miss Raven, noticing that her
companion had stopped, also turned round; and
she too received a shock. The face she saw was
so very white; the eyes&mdash;intently fixed on Miss
Smith&mdash;so strangely luminous; the head&mdash;covered
with red, shaggy hair&mdash;so disproportionately large;
and the figure&mdash;that of a hunchback youth&mdash;as a
whole so extraordinarily grotesque.</p>

<p>He made no sound, but, signing to them to follow
him, he began to move away with a queer, shambling
gait. The girls, thankful enough to have found a
guide, however strange, kept close at his heels,
and soon found themselves once again on the roadway.
Here their conductor came to a halt, and
producing from under his coat what looked like a
lady&rsquo;s reticule, he was about to thrust it into Miss
Smith&rsquo;s hand when their eyes met, and, to her
intense astonishment, he uttered a bitter cry of
disappointment and vanished. His action and
disappearance were so inexplicable that the girls,
completely demoralised, took to their heels and ran
without stopping till the ruins were far in their
rear, and they were well on their way home.</p>

<p>They related their experience to the people with
whom they were staying, and were then told for
the first time that the ruin was well known to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
haunted. &ldquo;Nothing will persuade any of the
villagers to visit the mill pond after dusk,&rdquo; their
hostess remarked, &ldquo;especially at this time of the
year, when they declare the water suddenly rises
and follows them. The place has a most sinister
reputation, and certainly several people, to my
knowledge, have committed suicide there. The
last to do so was Davy Dyer, the hunchback, whose
ghost you must have just seen. His was rather a
sad case, as I have good reason to know. Would
you like to hear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls eagerly assented, and their hostess told
them as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten years ago there stood on the spot you
visited this afternoon a very picturesque house
called the &lsquo;Gyp Mill.&rsquo; It was then extremely old,
and as its foundations were faulty, it was thought a
severe storm would, sooner or later, completely
demolish it. Partly for this reason, and partly
because the mill pool was said to be haunted, it
stood for a long time untenanted. At last it was
taken by a widow named Dyer. Mrs. Dyer was quite
a superior kind of person. She had at one time,
I believe, kept a fairly good class girls&rsquo; school in
Bury St. Edmunds, but losing her connection
through illness, she had been obliged to think of
some other means of gaining a livelihood. When
she came to the Gyp Mill she cultivated the garden
and sold its produce; provided teas for picnic parties
in the summer; and let out rooms, chiefly to artists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had one son, Davy, a very intelligent boy
of about eighteen, but hopelessly deformed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was not only hunchbacked but he had an abnormally
large head; and what was quite unpardonable
in the eyes of the village children, who
tormented him shamefully, a mass of the brightest
red hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one day, a girl whom I will call Beryl
Denver, came to stay with me. Beryl was extremely
pretty and horribly spoilt. She had gone on the
stage against her parents&rsquo; wishes and had been
an immediate success. At the time I am speaking
of she had just had an offer of marriage from a
duke, and it was to hear what I had to say about
it&mdash;for I am, I think, the only person from whom
she ever asks advice&mdash;that she was paying me this
visit. After being with me three days, however,
and changing her mind with regard to the duke&rsquo;s
offer at least a dozen times, she suddenly announced
that she must seek some more countrified
place to stay in. &lsquo;I want to go right away from
everywhere,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;so that I can forget&mdash;forget
that there is such a place as London. Don&rsquo;t
you know of any pretty cottage or picturesque
old farm, near here, that I could stay at?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suggested the Gyp Mill, and she started off
at once to look at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She came back full of enthusiasm. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a
delightful spot,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad I went to
see it&mdash;the flowers are lovely, and the old woman&rsquo;s
a dear&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t stay there. I couldn&rsquo;t
stand that hunchback son of hers. His white face
and big dark eyes alarmed me horribly. I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s at all right he should be at large.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Poor Davy,&rsquo; I remarked. &lsquo;His appearance
is certainly against him, but I can assure you he is
absolutely harmless. I know him well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beryl shook her head. &lsquo;You know my views,
Aunty,&rsquo; she said (she always calls me Aunty although
I am not related to her in any way). &lsquo;All
ugly people have a kink of badness in them somewhere.
They must be either cruel, or spiteful,
or treacherous, or, in some way or other, evilly
disposed. I am quite certain that looks reflect
the mind. No, I couldn&rsquo;t endure that boy. I
can&rsquo;t stay there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the morning, however, as I had fully anticipated,
she changed her mind. A fly was sent
for, and she drove off to the Gyp Mill, taking all
her luggage with her. How Mrs. Dyer ever got
it up her narrow staircase I can&rsquo;t think, but she
must have managed it somehow, for Beryl stayed
and, contrary to my expectations, for more than
one night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Davy, she afterwards informed me, soon got
on her nerves. Always when she went out she
caught him covertly peeping at her from behind
the window curtain of the little front parlour;
and if ever she stood for a moment to chat with
his mother, she could see him slyly watching her
through a chink in the doorway. She had seldom,
so far, met him out of doors; but as she was
returning from a walk one afternoon, she came
across a group of village children shouting at and
jostling someone very roughly in their midst, and
approaching nearer saw that the object of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
abuse was Davy, and that, in addition to pushing
and pummelling him, they were tormenting him
with stinging nettles&mdash;a very favourite device of
the children in this district. Filled with disgust,
rather than pity (Beryl, like most modern girls,
is wanting in real sentiment, and in this instance
simply hated to think that anyone could derive
amusement from so ungainly a creature), she
interfered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You abominable little wretches!&rsquo; she cried.
&lsquo;Leave him alone at once. Do you hear?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had a bomb fallen, the children could not have
been more surprised. One or two of the boys
were inclined to be rude, but on the rest the effect
of Beryl&rsquo;s looks and clothes (the latter in particular)
was magical. Gazing at her open-mouthed, they
drew back and allowed Davy to continue his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this, Davy peeped more than ever, and
Beryl, losing patience, determined to put a stop
to it. Catching him in the act of following her
through the fields one morning, she turned on him
in a fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How dare you?&rsquo; she demanded. &lsquo;How dare
you annoy me like this? Go home at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is my home, lady,&rsquo; Davy replied, his
eyes on the ground and his cheeks crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then you must choose some other route,&rsquo;
Beryl retorted; &lsquo;and for goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t be
everlastingly looking at me. I can&rsquo;t stand it. No
wonder those children rounded on you, you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
She was going to call him some very strong name&mdash;for
Beryl when roused didn&rsquo;t stick at trifles&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
suddenly checked herself. She began to realise
that this queer, distorted little object was in love
with her. Now no girl in London, probably, had
more admirers than Beryl. Peers, politicians,
authors, men of all vocations and classes had
succumbed to her beauty, and she had deemed
herself pretty well blasé. But here was a novelty.
A poor, ostracised rustic hunchback&mdash;the incarnation
of ugliness and simplicity. &lsquo;You know
how the horrible often fascinates one,&rsquo; she said
to me later, &lsquo;for instance, a nasty tooth, or some
other equally horrible defect in a person&rsquo;s face,
which one keeps on looking at however much one
tries not to&mdash;well, it was a fascination of this kind
that possessed me now. I felt I must see more
of the hunchback and egg him on to the utmost.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently it was owing to this fascination
that Beryl, changing her tactics, encouraged Davy
to talk to her, and assuming an interest in the
garden, which she knew was his one hobby, gradually
drew him out. Very shy and embarrassed at
first, he could only very briefly answer her questions;
but soon deceived by her manner&mdash;for Beryl could
act just as cleverly off the stage as on it&mdash;he grew
bolder, and talked well on his favourite subject,
natural history. He really knew a great deal, and
Beryl, despite the fact that she could hardly tell
the difference between a hollyhock and marigold,
couldn&rsquo;t help being impressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She walked home with him that day; and for
days afterwards she was often to be seen in his
company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll miss you dreadfully when you go,
ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; Mrs. Dyer said to her. &lsquo;He thinks the
world of you. He told me last night that he only
wished he could do something to show you how
grateful he is for your kindness to him.&rsquo; Of course,
Mrs. Dyer did not say that Davy was in love&mdash;but
Beryl knew it. She knew that to him she was a
deified being and that he absolutely adored her.
Thus matters stood, when a letter from the duke
made Beryl decide to leave Gyp Mill at once and
return with all speed to London. She walked to
the post office to dispatch a telegram, and Davy
went with her. Beryl knew that this would be the
last time, in all probability, that she would ever
walk with him; and feeling that she must find
out how far his love for her had progressed she
agreed to his proposal that they should return home
by a rather longer route. He wished, he said, to
show her a garden which was by far the prettiest
in all the country round, and it would not take
them more than a quarter of a mile or so out of their
way. Of course Beryl looked upon this suggestion
as a mere pretext on Davy&rsquo;s part for prolonging the
walk, and she wondered whether he would say
anything, or whether his passion would be held in
check by his natural respect for her superior social
position. She was disappointed. Although she
saw love for her shining more brightly than ever
in his eyes, he did not speak of it; he talked only of
flowers and of the great beauties of nature. Bored
to distraction, she at last cut him short, and, declaring
that she had no time to waste, hurried on. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
not until they had reached home that she discovered
she had lost her reticule, containing not only a
purse full of sovereigns but the letter she had just
received from the duke. She distinctly remembered
having it with her, she said, when Davy was prosing
over the stupid flowers, and she supposed she must
have left it somewhere in the garden, probably on
the seat where they had sat for a few minutes.
Davy, of course, went back at once to look for it,
but when he returned an hour or so later and in
crestfallen tones told her that he could not find
it, her anger knew no bounds. She did not actually
call him a fool, but she made him clearly understand
she thought him one; and he set off again almost
immediately to have another look for it. He did
not come back this time till close on midnight, and
he had not the courage to tell her of his failure.
His mother did it for him. Beryl went away early
the following morning, too indignant to shake hands
with either Mrs. Dyer or her son. &lsquo;If Davy didn&rsquo;t
actually take the reticule,&rsquo; she wrote to me some
days later, &lsquo;it was all owing to him&mdash;to his bothering
me to see that rotten garden&mdash;that I lost it; but
I firmly believe he has it. Ugly faces, you know,
are indicative of ugly minds&mdash;of a bad kink somewhere.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course the affair of the reticule soon became
public property. It was advertised for in the local
papers, and the woman in the post office told everybody
that she remembered seeing it in Beryl&rsquo;s hand
when she left the shop. &lsquo;Davy,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;was
with Miss Denver at the time, and I particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
noticed that he walked very close to her and watched
her in a peculiarly furtive manner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the villagers, with whom the Dyers had
always been unpopular, were not slow in taking up
the cue, and consequently Davy, now waylaid
by armies of children calling him thief, and even
beating him, never had a moment&rsquo;s peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last he was found one morning in the mill-pond
drowned, and it was generally believed that
remorse for his sins had made him commit suicide.
His mother alone thought otherwise. I did not
see Beryl nor hear anything of her for at least two
years after Davy&rsquo;s death, when to my surprise
she drove up to the door one day with her usual
pile of luggage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is it this time?&rsquo; I said, after we had
exchanged greetings. &lsquo;The duke again!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh dear no,&rsquo; Beryl replied. &lsquo;I broke it off
definitely with him long ago. He was too boring
for words, always dangling after me and never letting
me go out with anyone else. If he had been tolerably
good-looking I might have stood it, but he
wasn&rsquo;t. He was hopelessly plain. However, I
made some use of him, and he certainly gave me
good presents. I have been engaged several times
since, and I&rsquo;ve come now to ask your advice about
the Earl of C&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s eldest son. Shall I marry him
or not? Do you think he&rsquo;s worth it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not answer her at once, but let her ramble
on, till she suddenly turned to me and said, &lsquo;Do
you remember the last time I was here? Two
years ago! You know I stayed at that delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
old mill house&mdash;the Gyp something, and lost my
reticule. Well, I found it some time afterwards
in my hat-box. I hadn&rsquo;t taken it out with me that
day after all. And I could have sworn I had.
Wasn&rsquo;t it funny?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Extraordinary, perhaps,&rsquo; I remarked, with
rather more severity in my voice than I had ever
used to her before, &lsquo;but hardly funny.&rsquo; And I was
about to relate to her all that had occurred in
the interim, when something checked me. After
all, I thought, it would be just as well for this spoilt,
heartless little London actress to go to the Gyp
Mill and find out for herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I suppose I ought to have written to the
people and let them know,&rsquo; she said carelessly, &lsquo;but
I was really too busy. I always have such lots
to do. Such heaps of correspondence to attend to,
and so many visits to make. If it&rsquo;s a fine day to-morrow
I&rsquo;ll walk over and explain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not, of course, expect Beryl would go, but
greatly to my surprise, soon after luncheon, she
came into my bedroom in her hat and coat. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
off,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I think the walk will do me good.
And, look here, don&rsquo;t wait dinner for me, because
in all probability I&rsquo;ll stay the night. It all depends
upon how I feel. If I&rsquo;m not back by eight you
need not expect me till to-morrow. Bye-bye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She stole to my side and kissed me, and, armed
with an umbrella and mackintosh, set off up the
street. I watched her till she turned the corner.
Then I lay down and wondered what sort of a reception
she would meet with at the hands of Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Dyer. As the afternoon waned the sky grew ominously
dark, and the wind rose. Presently big drops
of rain spluttered against the window, and there
was every indication of a very severe storm. Had
Beryl been on good terms with Mrs. Dyer my mind
would have been at rest, as she would have been
able to take refuge at the Mill, but, knowing Mrs.
Dyer&rsquo;s feelings towards her, I doubted very much
if Mrs. Dyer would allow her to set foot within the
house; and she would have some distance to walk
before she could reach another shelter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down came the rain in grim earnest, and that
night witnessed the worst storm Norwich had known
for many years. Beryl did not return. I sat up
till twelve wondering what had become of her&mdash;for
despite this wayward child&rsquo;s many faults I
was much attached to her&mdash;and slept very little for
the rest of the night. In the morning my maid
came into my room in a breathless state of excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, mum,&rsquo; she exclaimed, &lsquo;the storm has
destroyed half Norfolk.&rsquo; (This, of course, I knew
to be an exaggeration.) &lsquo;What do you think!
Simkins&rsquo; Store is blowed down, nearly all the
chimneypots are off in Fore Street, and the milkman
has just told me the Gyp Mill is under water
and Mrs. Dyer is drowned!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What!&rsquo; I shrieked. &lsquo;The Gyp Mill under
water! Are you sure? Miss Denver was staying
there last night. Call a cab&mdash;I must go there at
once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The maid flew; and I was feverishly scrambling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
into my clothes, when, to my utmost relief, in
walked Beryl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So you&rsquo;ve heard,&rsquo; she said, looking rather pale,
but otherwise quite composed. &lsquo;The Gyp Mill
valley is under water, and old Mrs. Dyer is drowned.
It was rather lucky for me that I didn&rsquo;t go there
after all, wasn&rsquo;t it? Quite a narrow escape, in fact.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank God, you&rsquo;re safe!&rsquo; I exclaimed, drawing
her into my arms and kissing her frantically.
&lsquo;Tell me all about it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, there isn&rsquo;t much to tell,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;When
I got a mile or two on the road I found I had quite
forgotten the way, so I inquired of the first person I
met, a labourer, and he said, &ldquo;When you come to
the duck pond bear sharply to your left.&rdquo; Well,
I trudged on and on, and I am sure I must have gone
miles, but no duck pond; and I was beginning to
despair of ever seeing it, when a sudden swerve in
the road revealed it to me. The sky was very dark
and threatening, and the wind&mdash;you know how I
detest wind&mdash;sorely tried my temper. It was perfectly
fiendish. Well, when I got to the pond I
found there were two roads and I had quite forgotten
which of them I had to take. I was standing
there shivering, feeling horribly bored, when to my
joy a figure suddenly hove in view. It had grown
so dark that I could not make out whether the
stranger was a man or a woman. Besides, I
couldn&rsquo;t see a face at all, only a short, squat body
clad in some sort of ill-fitting fustian garment. I
shouted out, &ldquo;Can you tell me the way to the Gyp
Mill?&rdquo; but could get no reply. The strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
creature simply put out one hand, and taking the
road to the right, beckoned to me to follow. Then
I suddenly remembered that the other person&mdash;the
labouring man&mdash;had told me to take the road to the
left, and I ran after the curious-looking individual
shouting, &ldquo;The Gyp Mill.&mdash;Do you hear?&mdash;I
want to go to the Gyp Mill. Mrs. Dyer&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Again
I got no response, but the hand waved me on more
vigorously than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was now so dark that I could hardly see
where I was treading, and the wind was so strong
that I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my feet.
I battled on, however, and after what seemed to
me an eternity, we eventually stopped outside a
building that showed a twinkling light in one of the
windows. My conductor opened a wicket gate
and, signing to me to follow, walked me up a narrow
winding path to the front door. Here he halted
and, turning suddenly round on me, showed his face.
It was the Dyer boy&mdash;Davy, I think they called
him. Davy the hunchback.&rsquo; Here Beryl paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you quite sure?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Absolutely,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t mistake
him. There he was&mdash;with his hunchback,
huge head, cheeks looking whiter than ever&mdash;and
red hair. How I could see that it was red in the
dark I can&rsquo;t tell you, but all the same I could, and
moreover, the colour was very clear and distinct.
Well, he stood and looked at me for some seconds
beseechingly, and then said something&mdash;but so
quickly I couldn&rsquo;t catch what it was. I told him
so, and he repeated it, jabber, jabber, jabber. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
I grew angry. &ldquo;Why have you brought me here?&rdquo;
I shouted. &ldquo;I wanted to go to the Gyp Mill.&rdquo;
He spoke again in the same incomprehensible way,
and holding out his hands as if to implore my forgiveness,
suddenly disappeared. Where he went
to is a mystery. The rain had now begun to fall in
torrents, and to attempt to go on was madness.
Consequently, I rapped at the door and asked the
woman who opened it if she could put me up for the
night. &ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have a spare
room, if you don&rsquo;t mind it&rsquo;s being rather small.
The gentleman that has been staying here left this
morning. Did anyone recommend you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr.
Dyer brought me here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and, I believe, he
is somewhere outside.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr. Dyer!&rdquo; the woman
exclaimed, looking at me in the oddest manner.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a Mr. Dyer. Who do you mean?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why, Davy Dyer,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;the son of the old
woman who lives at the Mill. Davy Dyer, the
hunchback.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then, to my amazement, the woman caught
me by the arm. &ldquo;Davy Dyer, the hunchback!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;Why, miss, you must either be
dreaming or mad. Davy Dyer drowned himself in
the Mill pool two years ago!&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a><span class="g">CHAPTER VII</span><br />
<br />
THE COOMBE<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">A CASE OF A WILTSHIRE ELEMENTAL</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">People</span> are not half particular enough about new
houses. So long as the soil is gravel, so long as the
rooms are large and airy, the wall-papers artistic,
and there&rsquo;s no basement, the rest does not matter;
at least not as a rule. Few think of ghosts or of
superphysical influences. And yet the result of
such a consideration is what would probably weigh
most with me in selecting a newly built house.
But then, I have had disagreeable experiences, and
others I know have had them too.</p>

<p>Let me quote, for example, what befell my old
acquaintance, Fitzsimmons. Robert Fitzsimmons
was for years editor of the <cite>Daily Gossip</cite>, but
finally retired from the post owing to ill health.
His doctor recommended him some quiet, restful
place in the country, so he decided to migrate to
Wiltshire. After scouring the county for some
time, he alighted on a spot, not very far from
Devizes, that attracted him immensely.</p>

<p>It was prettily wooded, at least he called it
prettily wooded, within easy walking distance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the village of Arkabye, and about a quarter of a
mile from the site of an ancient barrow that had
just been removed to make way for several cottages.
Fitzsimmons loved beeches, particularly copper
beeches, which he noticed flourished here exceedingly,
and the thought of living surrounded by
these trees gave him infinite satisfaction. He
finally bought a small piece of land in the coombe,
getting it freehold at a ridiculously low figure, and
erected a house on it, which he called &ldquo;Shane
Garth&rdquo; after a remote ancestor.</p>

<p>The first month seems to have passed quite uneventfully.
It was true the children, Bobbie and
Jane, said they heard noises, and declared someone
always came and tapped against their window
after they were in bed; but Fitzsimmons attributed
these disturbances to mice and bats with which
the coombe was infested. One thing, however,
greatly disturbed his wife and himself, and that
was the naughtiness of the children. Prior to
their coming to the new house they had been as
good as gold and had got on extremely well together;
but the change of surroundings seemed
to have wrought in them a complete change of
character.</p>

<p>They were continually getting into mischief of
some sort, and hardly a day passed that they did
not quarrel and fight, and always in a remarkably
vindictive manner. Bobbie would creep up behind
Jane, and pull her hair and pinch her, whilst
Jane in revenge would break Bobbie&rsquo;s toys and do
something nasty to him while he slept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Then their language was so bad. They used
expressions that shocked everyone in the house, and
no one could say where they had picked them up.
But worst of all was their cruelty to animals.
The nurse came to Mrs. Fitzsimmons one morning
to show her a fowl that was limping across the yard
in great pain. Bobbie had pelted it with stones
and broken its leg.</p>

<p>He was punished; but the very next day he
and Jane were caught inflicting the most abominable
tortures on a mouse. Jane rivalled the
Chinese in the ingenuity of her cruelties. She
scalded insects very slowly to death, and scandalised
the village children by showing them a rabbit and
sundry smaller animals which she had vivisected
and skinned alive.</p>

<p>One does occasionally hear of epidemics of
cruelty breaking out in certain districts. A year
or two ago, cats came in for especially bad treatment
in the neighbourhood of Red Lion Square,
and the culprits, girls as well as boys, were invariably
excused, it being suggested that the war
had excited their naturally high spirits. I remember,
too, in Cornwall, not so very long ago, children
being seized with a mania for torturing birds.
They caught them with fish-hooks, and never grew
tired of watching them choke and writhe and otherwise
distort themselves in their death agonies. In
Wales, too, there are periodical outbursts of similar
passions. Some years ago a child was prosecuted
in South Wales for pulling a live rabbit in half;
but the magistrates acquitted the accused on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
plea that it was only following the example of nearly
all the other children in the district. Well, Robert
Fitzsimmons wondered if his children had fallen
victims to one of these epidemics, and he suggested
to his wife that they should be sent away to a
boarding school. To his astonishment, however,
Mrs. Fitzsimmons took a more lenient view of their
conduct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use being too hard on them,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe for one moment that Bobbie and
Jane realise that animals can feel as we do&mdash;that
human beings have not the monopoly of the nervous
system. We must get a governess&mdash;someone who
can explain things to them with tact and patience,
and not get out of temper, like you do, Robert.
The children must be treated with kindness and
sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fitzsimmons could hardly believe that it was his
wife speaking; she had been such a keen champion
of animals, and had boxed the ears of more than one
London ragamuffin whom she had caught ill-treating
a dog or cat. However, he gave way, and agreed
that the children should be committed to the care
of a benevolent old lady whom Mrs. Fitzsimmons
knew, and who might be engaged as governess and
domiciled in the house. This matter was barely
settled when Mr. Merryweather, an artist friend of
Robert Fitzsimmons, came to stay at Shane Garth,
and it was on the evening after his arrival that
Fitzsimmons first came to realise that the coombe
was haunted. He had been out all day fishing,
alone, his friend, Merryweather, being engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
painting a portrait of Mrs. Fitzsimmons and Jane;
and the evening having well set in, he was now on
his way home. Passing the site of the ancient
barrow, he could see in the hollow beneath him the
welcome lights of Shane Garth. He paused for a
moment to refill his pipe, and then commenced
to descend into the coombe. It was an exquisite
night, the air warm and fragrant with the scent of
newly mown hay, the moon full, and the sky one
mass of scintillating stars. Fitzsimmons was enchanted.
Again and again he threw back his head
and drew in the air in great gulps. When halfway
down the hill, however, he became aware of
a sudden change; the atmosphere was no longer
light and exhilarating, but dark, heavy, and oppressive.</p>

<p>He noticed, too, that there were strange lights
and that the shadows that flickered to and fro the
broad highway continually came and went, and
differed, in some strangely subtle fashion, from any
shadows he had ever seen before. But what
attracted his attention even more was a tree&mdash;a
tall tree with a trunk of the most peculiar colour.
In the quick-changing light of the coombe it looked
yellow&mdash;a lurid yellow streaked with black after
the nature of a tiger&rsquo;s skin&mdash;and Fitzsimmons never
remembered seeing it there before. He halted for a
moment to look at it more intently, and it seemed
to him to change its position. He rubbed his eyes
to make sure he was not dreaming and looked again.
Yes, without a doubt it was nearer to the roadway,
and very gradually it was getting nearer still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, although the night was still, so still
that hardly a leaf of any of the other trees quivered,
its branches were in a state of the most violent
agitation.</p>

<p>Fitzsimmons was not normally nervous, and on
the subject of the superphysical he was decidedly
sceptical; but he could not help admitting that it
was queer, and he began to wonder whether there
was not some other way of getting home. Ashamed,
however, of his cowardice, he at length made up his
mind to look closer at the tree, and ascertain if
possible the cause of its remarkable behaviour.
He advanced towards it, and it moved again.
This time the moonlight threw it into such strong
relief that it stood out with photographic clearness,
every detail in its composition most vividly
portrayed.</p>

<p>What exactly he saw, Fitzsimmons has never been
prevailed upon to say. All one can get out of him
is &ldquo;that it had the semblance to a tree, but that the
semblance was quite superficial. It was in reality
something quite different, and that the difference
was so marked and unexpected that he was immeasurably
shocked.&rdquo; I asked Fitzsimmons why
he was shocked, and he said, &ldquo;By the obscenity of
the thing&mdash;by its unparalleled beastliness.&rdquo; He
would not say any more. It took him several
minutes to sum up courage to pass it, and all the
while it stood close to the roadside waiting for
him. Fitzsimmons had been a tolerably good
athlete in his youth&mdash;he won the open hundred at
school&mdash;and though well over forty, he was spare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and tough, and as sound as a bell with regard to
his heart and lungs. Bracing himself up, he made
a sudden dash, and had passed it, by some dozen or
so yards, when he heard something drop with a soft
plumb, and the next minute there came the quick
patter of bare feet in hot pursuit. Frightened as he
was, Fitzsimmons does not think his terror was
quite so great as his feeling of utter loathing and
abhorrence. He felt if the thing touched him,
however slightly, he would be contaminated body
and soul, and would never be able to look a decent
person in the face again.</p>

<p>Hence his sprint was terrific&mdash;faster, he thinks,
than he ever did in the school Close&mdash;and he kept
praying too all the while.</p>

<p>But the thing gained on him, and he feels certain
it would have been all up with him, had not a party
of cyclists suddenly appeared on the scene and
scared it off. He heard it go back pattering up
the coombe, and there was something about those
sounds that told him more plainly than words that
he had not seen the last of it, and that it would
come to him again. When he entered the house
he encountered Merryweather and his wife together,
and he could not help noticing that they
seemed on strangely familiar terms and very upset
and startled at seeing him. He spoke to his wife
about it afterwards, and though she vehemently
denied there was any truth in his suspicions, she
could not meet his gaze with her customary frankness.
Merryweather was the last person on earth
he would have suspected of flirting with anyone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and up to the present time Mrs. Robert Fitzsimmons
had always behaved with the utmost propriety
and decorum; indeed, everyone regarded her as
a model wife and mother, and particular, even to
prudishness.</p>

<p>The incident worried Fitzsimmons a great deal,
and for nights he lay awake thinking about
it.</p>

<p>The governess was the next person to experience
the hauntings. Her room was a sort of attic,
large and full of quaint angles, and it looked out on
to the coombe. Well, one night she had gone to
bed rather early, owing to a very bad headache
which had been brought on by the behaviour of
the children, who had been naughty with a naughtiness
that could scarcely have been surpassed in
hell, and was partly undressed when her eyes
suddenly became centred on the wall-paper, which
had a curious dark pattern running through
it.</p>

<p>She looked at the pattern, and it suddenly took
the form of a tree. Now some people are in the
habit of seeing faces where others see nothing.
The governess belonged to the latter category.
She was absolutely practical and matter-of-fact,
a typical Midland farmer&rsquo;s daughter, and had no
imagination whatever. Consequently, when she
saw the tree, she at once regarded it in the light
of some peculiar phenomenon, and stared at it in
open-mouthed astonishment. At first it was simply
a tree, a tree with a well-defined trunk and branches.
Soon, however, the trunk became a vivid yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and black, a most unpleasant, virulent yellow, and
the branches seemed to move. Much alarmed, she
shrank away from it and clutched hold of the bed.
She afterwards declared that the tree suddenly
became something quite different, something she
never dare even think of, and which nothing in
God&rsquo;s world would ever make her mention. She
made one supreme effort to reach the bell, just
touched it with the tips of her fingers, and then
sank on the bed in a dead swoon.</p>

<p>She told her story next morning to Mrs. Fitzsimmons,
and although asked on no account to
breathe a word of it to the children, she told them
too. That night she took her departure, and Mrs.
Fitzsimmons refused her a character.</p>

<p>Curious noises were now frequently heard in the
house. Door handles turned and footsteps tiptoed
cautiously about the hall and passages at
about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitzsimmons was the next to have a nasty
experience. Going to her room one evening, when
everyone else was at supper, she saw the bed
valance suddenly move. Thinking it was the cat,
she bent down, and was about to call &ldquo;Puss,&rdquo; when
a huge striped thing, shaped, so she thought, something
like the trunk of a much gnarled tree, shot
out and, rolling swiftly past her, vanished in the
wainscoting. She called out, and Fitzsimmons,
who came running up, found her leaning against
the doorway of their room, laughing hysterically.</p>

<p>Two days later, on his return from another
fishing expedition, he found that his wife had gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
leaving a note for him pinned to the dressing-table.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see me again,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
off with Dicky Merryweather. We have discovered
we love one another, and that life apart would be
simply unendurable. Take care of the children,
and try and make them forget me. Get them away
from here, if you possibly can. I attribute everything&mdash;my
changed feelings towards you, and
Bobbie and Jane&rsquo;s naughtiness&mdash;to the presence of
that beastly thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="dots">.<span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span></p>

<p>Of course it was a terrible blow to Fitzsimmons,
and he told me that if it had not been for the children
he would have committed suicide there and then.
He was devotedly attached to his wife, and the
thought that she no longer cared for him made him
yearn to die.</p>

<p>However, Bobbie and Jane were dependent on
him, and for their sakes he determined to go on
living.</p>

<p>A week passed&mdash;to Fitzsimmons the saddest
and dreariest of his life&mdash;and he once again came
tramping home in the twilight.</p>

<p>Not troubling now whether he saw the ghost or
not, for there was no one to care whether he was
good or bad, or what became of him, he slouched
through the coombe with his long stride more
marked and apparent than usual. On nearing
the house and noticing that there was no bright
light, such as he had been accustomed to, in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of the front windows, but only the feeble flare of the
oil lamp over the front door, a terrible feeling of
loneliness came over him. He let himself in.
The hall was in semi-darkness, and he could hear no
sounds from the kitchen. He could see a glimmer of
light, however, issuing from under the kitchen door,
and he promptly steered for it. The cook, Agatha,
was sitting in front of the fire, reading a sixpenny
novel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is the house in darkness?&rdquo; Fitzsimmons
asked angrily. &ldquo;Surely it is dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cook yawned, and looking up at Fitzsimmons,
said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my place to light up. It&rsquo;s
Rosalie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Rosalie?&rdquo; Fitzsimmons demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the cook replied. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be
expected to know everything. The cooking&rsquo;s
enough for me&mdash;at least for the wages I get.
Rosalie&rsquo;s been gone somewhere for the last two
hours. I haven&rsquo;t seen or heard anything of her
since tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the children?&rdquo; Fitzsimmons inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the children&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; the cook answered&mdash;&ldquo;at
least I suppose so; and, you bet, they&rsquo;d have
let me know fast enough if they hadn&rsquo;t been. I
don&rsquo;t know which of the two hollers loudest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, get my supper, for mercy&rsquo;s sake, for I&rsquo;m
famishing,&rdquo; Fitzsimmons said; and he stalked back
again into the darkness.</p>

<p>After groping about the hall for some time and
knocking over a good few things, he at length put
his hands on a match-box, and lighting a candle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
made straight for the nursery. The children
had got into bed partially undressed, and were
sound asleep, with their heads well buried under the
bedclothes. Fitzsimmons contrived to uncover their
faces without waking them, and kissing them both
lightly on the forehead, he left them and went downstairs
to his study. Here he drew up a chair close to
the fire and, throwing himself into it, prepared to wait
till the gong sounded for supper. A slight noise
in the room made him look round. Across the
window recess, from which the sound apparently
came, a pair of heavy red curtains were tightly
drawn. Fitzsimmons rather wondered at this,
because Rosalie did not usually draw the curtains
before she lighted up; so he was still looking at them
and wondering, when they were suddenly shaken so
violently that the metal rings made a loud rattling
and jarring on the brass pole to which they were
attached. Fitzsimmons watched in breathless
anticipation. Every second he expected to see the
curtains part and some ghoulish face peering out
at him. Drawn curtains so often suggest lurking
horrors of that description. Instead, however,
the curtains only grew more and more agitated,
shaking violently as if they had the ague. Then,
all of a sudden, they were still. Fitzsimmons rose
and was about to look behind them, when they
started trembling again, and the one nearest the
fireplace began to bulge out in the middle. Fitzsimmons
stared at it with a sickening sense of foreboding.
At first it had no definite form, but, very
gradually, it assumed a shape, the shape he felt it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
would, and moved nearer him. For some seconds
he was too overcome with horror to do anything,
but his recollections of what it had looked like in
the coombe that night, and his utter detestation
of it, increased his fear, and in a frenzy of rage he
snatched up a revolver from the mantelpiece and fired
at it. Fitzsimmons thinks it was the bullet that
made it suddenly collapse; but I am inclined to
think it was the sound of the report&mdash;as sound
undoubtedly does, at times, bring about dematerialisation.
There are, I think, certain sounds that
generate vibrations in the air favourable to the
manifestation of spirits, and other sounds that
create vibratory motion destructive to the composition
of what are termed ghosts. And here was
an instance of the latter. Fitzsimmons waited for a
few minutes, until he felt sure the thing was gone
altogether, entirely quit of the premises, and then,
revolver in hand, pulled aside the curtains.</p>

<p>The next moment he reeled back, stupefied with
horror. Lying at full length on the floor, her white
face turned towards him, with a hideous grin of
agony on her lips, was Rosalie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; Fitzsimmons said to himself.
&ldquo;Good God! I&rsquo;ve killed her. What in Heaven&rsquo;s
name can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He deliberated shooting himself; and then the
cries of the children, who had been wakened by
the noise, reminding him of his duties to them,
he grew calmer, and telephoned at once for the
nearest doctor. The latter, happening to be at
home, was speedily on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you shot her,&rdquo; he remarked to Fitzsimmons,
after he had examined the body very
carefully. &ldquo;You must be dreaming, sir. There&rsquo;s
not the slightest sign of any bullet. Moreover, the
girl&rsquo;s been dead at least two hours. From the
look of her, I should say she died from strychnine
poisoning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor was right. The girl&rsquo;s death was due
to strychnine, and from the bottle that was found
in her possession and a message she scribbled on
the study wall, there is no doubt whatever she
committed suicide. &ldquo;I was a nice enough girl
till I came here,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the coombe
that&rsquo;s done it. Mother warned me against it.
Coombes make everyone bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this, Fitzsimmons decided to clear out.
Indeed, he could hardly have done otherwise, for
Shane Garth was now placed under a rigorous ban.
Agatha left&mdash;she did not even wait till the morning,
but cleared out the same night&mdash;and after that it
was impossible to get a woman to come in, even for
the day. Consequently, Fitzsimmons had not only
to cook and look after the children, but to do all
the packing as well. At last, however, it was all
over, and the carriage stood at the door, waiting
to take him and the children to the station. As
he came downstairs, followed by Bobbie and Jane,
someone, he fancied, called his name. He turned,
and Bobbie and Jane turned too.</p>

<p>Bending over the balustrades of the top landing,
and looking just like she had done in her lifetime,
save perhaps for the excessive pallor of her cheeks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and a curious expression of fear and entreaty in
her eyes, was Rosalie.</p>

<p>She faded away as they stared, and close beside
the spot where she had stood, they saw the dim
and shadowy outline of a gnarled tree.</p>

<br />
THE TRUNK<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">A STRANGE CASE OF HAUNTING IN SYDENHAM</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> other day I went to a matinée at &ldquo;The
St. James&rsquo;s.&rdquo; I am fond of French Revolutionary
plays, and <cite>The Aristocrat</cite> appealed to me, not only
by reason of its picturesqueness, which is happily
unimpaired by any slavish adherence to historical
accuracy, but also, and mostly, perhaps, by reason
of its pretty and unimpeachable sentiment. The
abandoned woman&mdash;a type so many of our
modern dramatists consider cannot be dispensed
with&mdash;apparently did not figure in this play at
all.</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon one of the principals
happened to be away, but as the part was played
to perfection by my young and charming compatriot,
Miss Nina Oldfield, instead of being disappointed,
I only experienced an additional pleasure.
I was leaning back in my seat during the interval,
thinking of Danton, Desmoulins, Marat, and other
of the romantic figures of that period, when someone
touched me on the shoulder and whispered,
&ldquo;Ghost man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not recognising the voice, I turned round sharply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
It was John Boulton, late dramatic critic of the
<cite>Arctus</cite>, now a staff captain, home on leave from
Egypt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just heard of a case that will interest you,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It bears out two of your theories,
namely, that all animals and insects have spirits,
and that spirits of all kinds, when freed from the
material body, can assume dimensions far exceeding&mdash;in
height especially&mdash;the dimensions of the
material body that they once inhabited. But
come on to my Club as soon as this show is over,
and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I accepted Boulton&rsquo;s invitation, and subsequently
listened to the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some friends of friends of mine, the Parminters,
recently took a small house in Sydenham. Now
Sydenham is not in the hey-day of its popularity.
Scores of the bigger houses are to let, and the
smaller ones&mdash;the majority at least&mdash;have not even
that air of genteel respectability which characterises
houses of the same size in some of the less remote
suburbs. Of course the train service is responsible
for much&mdash;even to think of a twenty-five minutes&rsquo;
journey into Town by train, when one can go
any distance on tube in next to no time, is both
intolerable and demoralising. But the decay of
the Palace&mdash;the Palace that twenty years ago all
London flocked to see&mdash;is in itself sufficient to have
generated that all-pervading atmosphere of sadness
that seems to have permeated people and houses,
alike, with its spirit of abandonment and desolation.
However, as a set-off against the many disadvantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of Sydenham, including its high rates and dull,
unattractive shops, there is its wonderful air&mdash;the
purest, so many doctors say, in England. And,
after all, what is of more consequence than pure
air which means health? At least, so the Parminters
argued when they gave up the idea of living right
in Town and bought this little two-storeyed villa
close to the Crystal Palace Station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had stood empty for years and was in a sad
state of dilapidation; but the owner, being on the
verge of bankruptcy, had no money to lay out
on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will let you have it for a very low figure,&rsquo; he
had said to them, &lsquo;provided you take it as it stands.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sum named was £120, and this the Parminters
considered, in spite of there being a pretty
stiff ground rent, a bargain price. Consequently,
they closed with the offer, had the house renovated,
and eventually moved in. On the day after their
arrival Mrs. Parminter made a discovery. Stowed
away in the loft was a long, weather-worn, bolster-shaped,
brown wooden trunk, bearing on it two
steamship company&rsquo;s labels, one marked Suez and
the other London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no address on it&mdash;no name. The
Parminters made inquiries of the builder who had
done the repairs and of the late owner of the house,
and neither could give them any clue as to the
person to whom it belonged. The landlord declared
that he had gone through all the rooms, including
the loft, immediately before giving up the keys to
Mrs. Parminter, and that he could swear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
when he did so there was nothing in the house at all,
no trunk of any description; whilst the builder
declared that both he and his men, when doing
the repairs, had seen the trunk in the loft and
had concluded that it belonged to the Parminters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, as nobody seems to want it, we had
better keep it,&rsquo; Mrs. Parminter remarked. &lsquo;I
wonder what it contains! It would be a pity to
force the lock, we must get a key to fit it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As no one happened to be going out just then,
the trunk was pushed on one side, and the Parminters,
having many other things to occupy their
minds, did not give it another thought. Tired out
with all the worry and work of &lsquo;moving in,&rsquo; they
went to bed early that night, in the room immediately
beneath the loft, and fell asleep almost as
soon as they had lain down. Parminter had the
digestion of an ox and, never over-taxing his brain,
slept, as a rule, right through the night. On this
occasion, however, he awoke with a violent start
to hear a strange, scraping sound on the floor
overhead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just as if someone was drawing the
rough edge of a stone backwards and forwards on the
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This went on for some seconds; then it abruptly
ceased, and the stairs, leading from the landing
outside the Parminters&rsquo; room to the loft, gave a
series of loud creaks. Of course stairs often creak,
and one excuses their conduct on the ground of
natural causes. The wood, we say, cannot expand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
or contract, when certain changes in the temperature
take place, without making some little noise,
and vibration due to the passing by of some heavy
vehicle must be accompanied by some slight sound.
But why, I ask, do we not hear creaks in the daytime,
when the traffic is more constant and changes
in the temperature quite as marked? Parminter
was not an imaginative man; on the contrary, he
was practical to a degree. He had a hearty contempt
for anything in the nature of superstition,
and regarded all so-called psychists either as
charlatans or lunatics. Yet, when he listened to
this creaking, he was bound to admit that there was
something about it that bothered and perplexed
him. He got up and opened the door. There was
no moon, but, on the staircase, there was a long
streak of leadish blue light, that moved as Parminter
stared at it, and slowly began to descend. The
stairs creaked under it and, though he could see
nothing beyond the light, he could hear the most
peculiar rattling, scraping sound, as if some metal-clad
body was in course of transit. The thing,
whatever it was, at last arrived on the landing,
where it remained stationary. A feeling of unutterable
horror and repulsion now came over
Parminter, and, springing back into the room, he
shut and locked the door. The noise awoke his
wife, and they both stood by the door and listened,
as the creaking and rattling was renewed and the
thing crossed the landing and descended the stairs
into the hall. Presently there came a savage snarl,
which ended in a shrill whine, that was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
human in the intensity of its agony and terror,
and after that, silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Puck!&rsquo; Mrs. Parminter ejaculated, her
teeth chattering. &lsquo;What can have happened to
him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God knows,&rsquo; Parminter replied. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going
to see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They stood there shivering in their night clothes,
until, from the absolute stillness of the house, they
concluded that the thing had gone; then they
lighted candles and, slipping into their dressing-gowns,
descended the stairs. Puck was crouching
on the mat by the drawing-room door, in an attitude
he often assumed when well scolded. They called
him by his name. He did not answer. Then
they bent over him and patted his head. Still
he did not stir, and when they came to examine
him more closely they discovered he was
dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Determined to get to the bottom of the mystery,
Parminter, the following night, sprinkled the stairs
all over with flour and sand. The same thing
happened. First of all the scraping immediately
overhead, then the creaking and rattling on the
stairs, then the pause, and then the slow and
stealthy descent, accompanied by the same combination
of noises, into the hall. When all was
still again, they examined the flour and sand. There
were no imprints on it of any kind, and apparently
it had not been touched, for it bore no sign whatever
of anything having passed over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still Parminter would not acknowledge the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
possibility of the superphysical. &lsquo;The noises
we&rsquo;ve heard,&rsquo; he remarked, &lsquo;are simply the result
of some curious acoustic property, not uncommon,
perhaps, if we only knew it, in houses of this description.
And what I saw on the stairs is, of course,
merely the effect of some trick of the light which
anyone who understands natural science could
easily explain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, all I can say is that I should like to
have the whole thing explained, and to know
what these natural causes that you&rsquo;re so fond of
talking about really are,&rsquo; rejoined Mrs. Parminter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So should I,&rsquo; Parminter replied. &lsquo;But I
can&rsquo;t explain it, because I&rsquo;m not a scientist.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, get one,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;Get Professor
Keipler.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Keipler was the only scientist the Parminters
knew. He was a German, and at that time
happened to be living in Penge. At Parminter&rsquo;s
request he came over to Sydenham and accepted
an invitation to stay the night. Parminter showed
him the loft, and the Professor made a very careful
examination of it, pulling up one or two boards
and peering into all the cracks and crevices. He
tested the walls and stairs too, and admitted that
he could discern nothing there that could account
for some, at least, of the noises the Parminters
described. When bedtime came, instead of retiring
to rest, Parminter lowered all the lights,
and they all three sat on the landing and
waited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely at the same time as on the previous
night they heard the scraping sound in the loft,
then the gentle opening of a door, then a rattling
of metal; and then&mdash;Parminter caught the Professor
by the arm&mdash;a long, luminous something
came into view. Instead, however, of descending
the stairs, it mounted the wall and suddenly
shot down towards them like a streak of
lightning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Parminter screamed, Parminter tightened
his hold of the Professor, and the next thing they
knew was that they were all three rolling on the
floor with something huge and scaly crawling over
them. It conveyed the impression that it was
some gigantic, venomous, and indescribably hideous
insect, furnished with many long and dreadful
legs, and they shrank from its touch just as they
would have shrunk from the touch of an enormous
spider, black-beetle, or other creature to which they
had a special aversion. The Professor had brought
with him a very powerful electric torch. In the
first panic it had slipped from his grasp and rolled
away into the darkness, but his fingers eventually
coming into contact with it, he pressed the button.
In an instant the landing was flooded with light,
and the thing of horror had gone. Parminter then
lit the incandescent gas, and they all three went
downstairs into the dining-room and had brandies
and soda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, how do you account for it?&rsquo; Parminter
said to the Professor. &lsquo;What do you think it
was?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing that I can explain by any known
physical law,&rsquo; the Professor replied. &lsquo;I never
believed in the possibility of the superphysical
before, but I am convinced of it now. What struck
me most about that thing, even more than its
extraordinary property of completely vanishing
under the influence of light, was its malignancy.
Didn&rsquo;t you feel how intensely antagonistic it was
to us?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Parminter said. &lsquo;I did.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; the Professor went on, &lsquo;such antagonism,
such concentrated spleen and venom and
bloodthirstiness&mdash;I felt the thing wanted to crush,
tear, mangle, lacerate, poison me&mdash;could only
originate in Hell&mdash;in a world altogether distinct
from ours, where cruelty and maliciousness attain
dimensions entirely beyond the scope of the physical.
My advice to you is to quit the house with all haste,
lest something really evil befall you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having only just moved in, and spent a lot of
money on the place, the Parminters naturally did
not feel inclined to carry out this advice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If the place is haunted,&rsquo; they argued, &lsquo;we can
surely get rid of the ghost by exorcism or some
other device.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They consulted several of their friends, and
were finally persuaded to call in a priest&mdash;an
Anglican, from a parish in the East End, that
Mrs. Parminter used to visit when they lived in
town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Parminters did not tell me exactly what
Father S&mdash;&mdash; did (I believe there is a special form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of exorcism practised in the Church), but anyhow
he could not proceed; his nerves, so he himself
admitted, went all to bits, and directly the long
streak of light began to crawl towards him he
turned tail and fled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another clerical friend whom the Parminters
called in to exorcise the ghost did, I believe, complete
the service; but it had no effect&mdash;the thing
mounted the wall, just as it had done before, and
darting downwards put the exorciser to instant
flight. The Parminters next resolved to try a
West End occultist. It was an expensive proceeding;
but terms were at length agreed upon,
and the following night the renowned psychic
arrived to lay the ghost. When it was time for it
to appear, this exorciser insisted upon the Parminters
retiring to their room, whilst he himself
remained outside on the landing alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They heard him repeat a lot of gibberish, as
Parminter afterwards described it to me; and
then he rapped at their door and told them they
need not worry any more as he had seen the ghost,
the spirit of a monk, and given it the consolation
it needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But why did the monk crawl and make
such a queer rattling noise?&rsquo; Mrs. Parminter
inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because just before he died he lost the use
of his limbs,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;Spirits, you know,
always come back in the state they were in immediately
prior to their death. The rattling was due
to the fact that he wore armour; so many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
old monks combined two professions, that of soldier
and priest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But how about the speed with which the
thing darted at us,&rsquo; Parminter said, &lsquo;and the feeling
we all had that it possessed innumerable legs?
That doesn&rsquo;t look much like a disabled monk,
does it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t appear like that to me,&rsquo; the occultist
replied. &lsquo;In all probability you had that impression
because your psychic faculties are not sufficiently
developed. At present you see spirits all
out of focus, as it were&mdash;not in their true perspective.
If you went through a proper course of
training at some psychic college, you would see
them just as I do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Possibly,&rsquo; Parminter said, &lsquo;but how about the
gas? I see you had it full on all the time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That would make no difference in my case,&rsquo;
the occultist replied, &lsquo;because to anyone of my advanced
learning ghosts can materialise in the light
just as well as in the dark.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then you feel certain the hauntings have now
ceased?&rsquo; Mrs. Parminter observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is what the monk told me,&rsquo; was the
reply; &lsquo;and now, if you will kindly pay me my fee,
I will go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parminter gave him a cheque, and he went.
An hour later, when the Parminters were in bed and
the house was still and dark, they heard the scraping
on the floor overhead, and the thing came down.
This time neither of them stirred, and the thing, as
before, passed their room and descended into the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The following morning Mrs. Parminter received
a letter from her sister, Mrs. Fellowes, asking her if
she could put up the two children, Flo and Maisie,
their maid, and herself for a week. It was extremely
inconvenient just then for Mrs. Parminter
to have visitors, and had it been anyone else she
would have refused; but she was devoted to this
particular sister, and at once wrote back bidding
her come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house was rather oddly constructed. On
the top story were three rooms, two quite a decent
size, but the third barely big enough for a bed, and
having two doors, one of which opened on to the
landing and the other into the loft. The loft was
very large, but so dark and badly ventilated that
it could not possibly be used for sleeping purposes.
Every room in the house being required, Mrs.
Fellowes&rsquo; nursemaid, Lily, was put to sleep in the
room adjoining the loft, whilst Flo and Maisie
occupied one of the two larger rooms, and the Parminters&rsquo;
cook and housemaid the other. For the
first two nights after the arrival of the visitors there
were no disturbances, although Lily complained
that she had never slept worse in her life. On the
third day of their stay the children were invited out
to tea, and their mother accompanied them. When
they returned they inquired for Lily, and being told
that she had been in her room all the afternoon, they
ran upstairs to see if anything was the matter with
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maisie knocked, and receiving no reply, opened
the door and peeped in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lily was lying on the bed, and on the top of her,
its long antennæ waving over her face, was an
enormous scaly thing with a hideous jointed body
and hundreds of poisonous-looking black legs. Its
appearance was so terrific, so unmistakably evil
and savage, that Maisie was petrified, and stood
staring at it, unable to move or utter a
sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flo, wondering what had happened, peeped
over her sister&rsquo;s shoulders, and was equally shocked.
Just then someone came running upstairs, making
a great noise, and the thing slowly vanished. The
children then recovered the use of their tongue, and
shrieked for help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parminter, happening to enter the house at
that moment, ran to the assistance of the children,
and in a few moments the whole household was on
the top landing. Lily was unconscious, and for
days she was so ill that the doctor held out very
little hope of her recovery. In the end, however,
she pulled round, but both her throat and heart
were permanently affected. Soon after this event
the Parminters resold the house, as they felt they
could not remain in it any longer. They had stored
a good many things in the loft, and, on removing
them, they came across the trunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, we never opened it,&rsquo; Mrs. Parminter
cried, trying in vain to lift up the lid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No; we were going to get a key, and then forgot
all about it,&rsquo; Parminter replied. &lsquo;But we&rsquo;ll soon
remedy that. I&rsquo;ll send for a locksmith at
once.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He did so, and the man, at last finding a key
that fitted, opened the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not quite empty; on the bottom of it,
stuck firmly down with two big hatpins, its long legs
spread out on either side of it like a hideous fringe,
was a black Indian centipede.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
THE COUGH<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">A CASE OF HAUNTING IN REGENCY SQUARE,
BRIGHTON</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I know</span> a man called Harrison. So, in all probability,
do you; so, in all probability, do most
people. But it is not everyone, I imagine, that
knows a Harrison who delights in the Christian
name of Pelamon, and it is not everyone that
knows a Pelamon Harrison who indulges in psychical
research. Now some people think that no one
unless he be a member of the Psychical Research
Society can know anything of ghosts. That is a
fallacy. I have met many people who, although
they have had considerable experience in haunted
houses, have never set a foot in Hanover Square;
and, vice versa, I have met many people who,
although they have been members of the Psychical
Research Society, have assured me they have never
seen a ghost. Pelamon Harrison belongs to the
former category. He is by vocation a gentleman
undertaker, and he lives in Sussex. Some years
ago, after the publication of my novel <cite>For Satan&rsquo;s
Sake</cite>, which was very severely criticised in certain
of the religious denominational papers, Pelamon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Harrison, championing my cause, wrote me rather
an interesting letter. I went to see him, and ever
since then he has not only supplied me with detailed
information of all the hauntings he has come
across, but he has at times sent me accounts of his
own experiences. This is one of them.</p>

<p>Pelamon was seated in his office one day reading
Poe, when the telephone at his elbow started ringing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Pelamon. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only me&mdash;Phoebe Hunt,&rdquo; was the reply.
(Phoebe Hunt was Pelamon Harrison&rsquo;s housekeeper.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything the matter?&rdquo; Pelamon asked anxiously.
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; Mrs. Hunt replied, &ldquo;only a rather
queer-looking gentleman has just called and seemed
most anxious to see you. He says he has been told
about you by Mr. Elliot O&rsquo;Donnell, and he wants
you to go at once to a house in Regency Square,
Brighton, No. &mdash;. He says it is very badly
haunted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; Pelamon demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nimkin,&rdquo; Mrs. Hunt answered, and she very
carefully spelt the name&mdash;&ldquo;N&nbsp;I&nbsp;M&nbsp;K&nbsp;I&nbsp;N.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; Pelamon said, &ldquo;and if
I&rsquo;m not home by seven o&rsquo;clock, don&rsquo;t expect me till
the morning.&rdquo; He then rang off, and thinking
it was time he did some work, he took up his account
book.</p>

<p>Try as he would, however, he could not keep his
mind from wandering. Something kept whispering
in his ear &ldquo;Nimkin,&rdquo; and something kept telling him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that his presence was urgently needed in Regency
Square.</p>

<p>At last, unable to stand it any longer, he threw
down his pen and, picking up his hat and coat,
hurried off to the railway station.</p>

<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock that evening he stood on the
pavement immediately in front of No. &mdash; Regency
Square. All the blinds were down, and this circumstance,
combined with an atmosphere of
silence and desolation, told him that the house
was no longer inhabited. Somewhat perplexed, he
asked the servant next door if she could tell him
where Mr. Nimkin lived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in Heaven,&rdquo; the girl replied tartly. &ldquo;He
did live in No. &mdash; till his wife died, but after that he
went to live on the other side of the town. He
died himself a few days ago, and I believe his funeral
took place this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And No. &mdash; where his wife died is now empty,&rdquo;
Pelamon observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s been empty ever since,&rdquo; she replied,
and, sinking her voice to a whisper, &ldquo;folks say
it&rsquo;s haunted. I can&rsquo;t altogether bring myself to
believe in ghosts&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve heard noises,&rdquo; and she
laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had he any children?&rdquo; Pelamon asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the girl answered, &ldquo;and he has left the
money he hoarded&mdash;he was the meanest of old
sticks&mdash;to the hospital for consumptives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A worthy cause,&rdquo; Pelamon commented.</p>

<p>The girl nodded. &ldquo;His wife was a consumptive,&rdquo;
she went on. &ldquo;I remember her well&mdash;a pretty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
fair-haired creature with a lovely skin, and&rdquo;&mdash;here
she shuddered&mdash;&ldquo;a shocking cough.&rdquo; Then,
thrusting her head close to Pelamon, and fixing him
with a frightened glance, she whispered, &ldquo;It was
the cough that killed her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pelamon stared at her in astonishment. &ldquo;Why,
of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the cough that kills all
consumptives. I&rsquo;ve buried scores of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but I daren&rsquo;t tell you any more;
and, after all, it&rsquo;s only what we thought. Anyhow,
he&rsquo;s dead now, and a good job too. Did you want
to see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was nothing very particular,&rdquo; Pelamon
replied. &ldquo;Who has the keys of the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s jaws dropped and her eyes grew as big
as turtle&rsquo;s eggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The keys!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Mercy on us,
you don&rsquo;t intend going there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business,&rdquo; Pelamon replied haughtily;
and then, not wishing to offend her, he added: &ldquo;I
heard the place was to be let, and as I want a house
in this particular locality, I thought I would call
and look at it, that&rsquo;s all! I am not a burglar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl giggled. &ldquo;A burglar!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh
no, you&rsquo;re not sharp enough for that. Besides,
the house is empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Pelamon exclaimed. &ldquo;Has all the
furniture been taken away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All but the blinds,&rdquo; the girl nodded. &ldquo;There
was a sale here the day after Mrs. Nimkin was
buried, and at it crowds of people; some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
furniture fetched an enormous price. I did hear
that the house was sold too, but I&rsquo;ll ask the missus
to make sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ran upstairs, and returned in a few minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the house is sold, and the
new people are coming in soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that settles the matter,&rdquo; Pelamon said,
and, thanking her in his usual terse and precise
way, he withdrew.</p>

<p>He took a brief turn on the sea front, thinking
all the time of Regency Square and the mysterious
individual who had interviewed Mrs. Hunt, and
who must be, he thought, related to the Nimkin
who had been buried that afternoon. At nine
o&rsquo;clock he was once again in the square. Entering
the garden of No. &mdash;, he crept round to the back
of the house and, finding the catch of one of the
windows undone, he raised the sash and climbed in.</p>

<p>He had an electric torch with him, and consequently
he was able to find his way about.
Pelamon is very susceptible to the influence of the
superphysical, and is probably far more of a psychic
than the majority of those who earn their living
as professional mediums. He told me afterwards
that he knew No. &mdash; was haunted the moment he
set his foot inside it. He could detect the presence
of the superphysical both in the atmosphere and
also in the shadows. Frequently in the death
chambers which he had attended he had seen
a certain type of shadow on the floor by the bed;
and it was this same queer kind of shadow, he
said, that now crept out from the wall to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
him. But it was not the only phenomenon.
From just where the shadow lay, there came a
cough, a nervous, worrying cough, a regular hack,
hack, hack, and when Pelamon moved, the cough
and the shadow moved too. He went all over
the house, into every room; and the cough and
the shadow followed him. Hack, hack, hack, he
could not get rid of it. At first it merely irritated
him; but after a while he grew angry, infuriated,
maddened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Stop it! Stop
that vile, infernal hacking. Damn you! Curse
you! <strong class="smcap">Stop</strong> it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the coughing went on, and in a hideous fit
of rage, Pelamon flew at the shadow, jumped on
it, stamped on it, and drawing out his clasp knife,
knelt down and deliberately stabbed it. Still it
went on, untiringly, ceaselessly, significantly, hack,
hack, hack. Pelamon was still on the floor cutting,
stabbing, blaspheming, when a taxi suddenly drew
up outside the house, and the next moment the
front-door bell gave a loud birr. Pelamon waited
till it had rung twice; then he answered it. A
chauffeur stood on the doorstep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to the wrong house,&rdquo; Pelamon
said to him. &ldquo;No taxi is wanted here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is No. &mdash;, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the man ejaculated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pelamon replied. &ldquo;It is No. &mdash;, but
that doesn&rsquo;t simplify matters. Who sent for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gentleman as lives on t&rsquo;other side of the
town,&rdquo; the chauffeur replied. &ldquo;He called out to
me as I was passing his house. &lsquo;Do you want a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
job?&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Will you drive to No. &mdash; Regency
Square and fetch a lady and gentleman? You&rsquo;ll
find them there waiting for you. The gent&rsquo;s
name is Harrison&rsquo; (Pellijohn Harrison, I think
he said, but I couldn&rsquo;t quite catch it). &lsquo;Never
mind the lady&rsquo;s. Bring &rsquo;em both here.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very extraordinary,&rdquo; Pelamon exclaimed,
&ldquo;for that&rsquo;s my name, without a doubt. But I
don&rsquo;t know who the gentleman could have been,
and there&rsquo;s no lady here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe there ain&rsquo;t no lady in the house now,&rdquo;
the chauffeur said dryly, &ldquo;because she&rsquo;s just got
in the taxi. But she was there a second or two ago.
You do like your bit of fun, don&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pelamon, in a great state of bewilderment, was
about to say something, when from the direction
of the taxi came the cough, hack, hack, hack. He
knew it too well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; the chauffeur said, with a leer.
&ldquo;You must admit she&rsquo;s in there right enough,
and waiting till you&rsquo;re ready to join her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Possessed with the feeling that he must see the
thing through, Pelamon hesitated no longer. He
got into the taxi. The coughing went on, but he
could see no lady.</p>

<p>They drove right through the town, and at last
stopped outside a small villa facing a church or
chapel. Concluding this must be their destination,
Pelamon got out and, bidding the chauffeur wait,
rang the front-door bell. There was no response.
He looked at the windows; there was not a vestige
of light anywhere and the blinds were all tightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
drawn. He rang again, and rapped as well, and
was about to do so a third time, when a window
in the next house was raised and a voice called
out: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one there. There&rsquo;s been a funeral
to-day and the house is empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose funeral was it?&rdquo; Pelamon asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Nimkin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;he died last
Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what are you a-talking about?&rdquo; the
chauffeur called out, descending from his perch and
joining Pelamon on the doorstep. &ldquo;Nimkin!
Why, that was the name of the bloke as was here
less than an hour ago and told me to fetch this
gentleman. No one in the house indeed, why,
he&rsquo;s in it, and the lady that came along with this
gentleman here, she&rsquo;s in it too. Listen to her
coughing,&rdquo; and, as he spoke, from the other side of
the closed door came the familiar sounds, hack,
hack, hack.</p>

<br />
THE SYDERSTONE HAUNTINGS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago I published in a work entitled
<cite>Ghostly Phenomena</cite> (Werner Laurie &amp; Co.) an
account, sent me by the late Rev. Henry Hacon,
M.A., of Searly Vicarage, North Kelsey Moor, of
hauntings that once occurred in the Old Syderstone
Parsonage (the present Rectory has never, so I
understand, been in any way disturbed). Thanks
to the kindness and courtesy of Mr. E.&nbsp;A. Spurgin
of Temple Balsall, Warwickshire (grandson of the
Rev. John Spurgin), I am now able to reproduce
further correspondence relative to the same case,
written at the time of the occurrence&mdash;over eighty
years ago.</p>

<p>The following paragraphs appeared in the <cite>Norfolk
Chronicle</cite>, June 1, 1833:&mdash;</p>


<p class="hd">&ldquo;A Real Ghost</p>

<p>&ldquo;The following circumstance has been creating
some agitation in the neighbourhood of Fakenham
for the last few weeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Syderstone Parsonage lives the Rev. Mr.
Stewart, curate, and rector of Thwaite. About
six weeks since an unaccountable knocking was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
heard in it in the middle of the night. The family
became alarmed, not being able to discover the
cause. Since then it has gradually been becoming
more violent, until it has now arrived at such a
frightful pitch that one of the servants has left
through absolute terror. The noises commence
almost every morning about two, and continue
until daylight. Sometimes it is a knocking, now
in the ceiling overhead, now in the wall, and now
directly under the feet; sometimes it is a low
moaning, which the Rev. Gentleman says reminds
him very much of the moans of a soldier on being
whipped; and sometimes it is like the sounding of
brass, the rattling of iron, or the clashing of earthenware
or glass; but nothing in the house is disturbed.
It never speaks, but will beat to a lively tune and
moan at a solemn one, especially at the morning
and evening hymns. Every part of the house has
been carefully examined, to see that no one could
be secreted, and the doors and windows are always
fastened with the greatest caution. Both the inside
and outside of the house have been carefully examined
during the time of the noises, which always
arouse the family from their slumbers, and oblige
them to get up; but nothing has been discovered.
It is heard by everyone present, and several ladies
and gentlemen in the neighbourhood, who, to
satisfy themselves, have remained all night with
Mr. Stewart&rsquo;s family, have heard the same noise,
and have been equally surprised and frightened.
Mr. Stewart has also offered any of the tradespeople
in the village an opportunity of remaining in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
house and convincing themselves. The shrieking
last Wednesday week was terrific. It was formerly
reported in the village that the house was haunted
by a Rev. Gentleman, whose name was Mantal,
who died there about twenty-seven years since,
and this is now generally believed to be the case.
His vault, in the inside of the church, has lately
been repaired, and a new stone put down. The
house is adjoining the churchyard, which has
added, in no inconsiderable degree, to the horror
which pervades the villagers. The delusion must
be very ingeniously conducted, but at this time of
day scarcely anyone can be found to believe these
noises proceed from any other than natural causes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Wednesday se&rsquo;nnight, Mr. Stewart requested
several most respectable gentlemen to sit up all
night&mdash;namely, the Rev. Mr. Spurgeon of Docking,
the Rev. Mr. Goggs of Creake, the Rev. Mr. Lloyd
of Massingham, the Rev. Mr. Titlow of Norwich,
and Mr. Banks, surgeon, of Holt, and also Mrs.
Spurgeon. Especial care was taken that no tricks
should be played by the servants; but, as if to give
the visitors a grand treat, the noises were even
louder and of longer continuance than usual. The
first commencement was in the bed-chamber of
Miss Stewart, and seemed like the clawing of a
voracious animal after its prey. Mrs. Spurgeon
was at the moment leaning against the bed-post,
and the effect on all present was like a shock of
electricity. The bed was on all sides clear from
the wall; but nothing was visible. Three powerful
knocks were then given to the side-board, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the hand of Mr. Goggs was upon it. The disturber
was conjured to speak, but answered only by a low
hollow moaning; but on being requested to give
three knocks, it gave three most tremendous blows
apparently in the wall. The noises, some of which
were as loud as those of a hammer on the anvil,
lasted from between eleven and twelve o&rsquo;clock until
near two hours after sunrise. The following is the
account given by one of the gentlemen: &lsquo;We all
heard distinct sounds of various kinds&mdash;from
various parts of the room and the air&mdash;in the midst
of us&mdash;nay, we felt the vibrations of parts of the bed
as struck; but we were quite unable to assign any
possible natural cause as producing all or any part
of this. We had a variety of thoughts and explanations
passing in our minds <em>before</em> we were on the
spot, but we left it all equally bewildered.&rsquo; On
another night the family collected in a room where
the noise had never been heard; the maid-servants
sat sewing round a table, under the especial notice
of Mrs. Stewart, and the man-servant, with his
legs crossed and his hands upon his knees, under
the cognisance of his master. The noise was then
for the first time heard there&mdash;&lsquo;above, around,
beneath, confusion all&rsquo;&mdash;but nothing seen, nothing
disturbed, nothing felt except a vibratory agitation
of the air, or a tremulous movement of the tables
or what was upon them. It would be in vain to
attempt to particularise all the various noises,
knockings, and melancholy groanings of this mysterious
something. Few nights pass away without
its visitation, and each one brings its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
variety. We have little doubt that we shall ultimately
learn that this midnight disturber is but
another &lsquo;<cite>Tommy Tadpole</cite>,&rsquo; but from the respectability
and superior intelligence of the parties who have
attempted to investigate into the secret, we are
quite willing to allow to the believers in the earthly
visitations of ghosts all the support which this
circumstance will afford to their creed&mdash;that of
<em>unaccountable mystery</em>. We understand that inquiries
on the subject have been very numerous,
and we believe we may even say troublesome, if
not expensive.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l4" />

<p class="hd">&ldquo;Syderstone Parsonage</p>

<p class="sal1">&ldquo;<i>To the Editor of the Norfolk Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;My name having lately appeared in the
<cite>Bury Post</cite>, as well as in your own journal, without
my consent or knowledge, I doubt not you will
allow me the opportunity of occupying some portion
of your paper, in way of explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is most true that, at the request of the Rev.
Mr. Stewart, I was at the Parsonage at Syderstone,
on the night of the 15th ult., for the purpose of
investigating the cause of the several interruptions
to which Mr. Stewart and his family have been
subject for the last three or four months. I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
it right, therefore, to correct some of the erroneous
impressions which the paragraph in question is
calculated to make upon the public mind, and at
the same time to state fairly the leading circumstances
which transpired that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At ten minutes before two in the morning,
&lsquo;<em>knocks</em>&rsquo; were distinctly heard; they continued at
intervals, until after sunrise&mdash;sometimes proceeding
from the bed&rsquo;s-head, sometimes from the side-boards
of the children&rsquo;s bed, sometimes from a three-inch
partition, separating the children&rsquo;s sleeping-rooms;
both sides of which partition were open to observation.
On two or three occasions, also, when a
definite number of blows was requested to be
given, the precise number required was distinctly
heard. <em>How</em> these blows were occasioned was the
subject of diligent search: every object was before
us, but nothing satisfactorily to account for them;
no trace of any human hand, or of mechanical
power, was to be discovered. Still, I would remark,
though perfectly distinct, these knocks were by no
means so powerful as your paragraph represents&mdash;indeed,
instead of &lsquo;<em>being even louder, and of longer
continuance that night</em>, as if to give <em>the visitors a
grand treat</em>,&rsquo; it would seem they were neither <em>so</em>
loud nor <em>so</em> frequent as they commonly had been.
In several instances they were particularly gentle,
and the pauses between them afforded all who were
present the opportunity of exercising the most calm
judgment and deliberate investigation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would next notice the &lsquo;<em>vibrations</em>&rsquo; on the side-board
and post of the children&rsquo;s beds. These were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
distinctly felt by myself as well as others, not
only once, but frequently. They were obviously
the effect of different blows, given in some way or
other, upon the different parts of the beds, in
several instances while those parts were actually
under our hands. It is not true that &lsquo;<em>the effect
on all present was like a shock of electricity</em>,&rsquo; but
that these &lsquo;<em>vibrations</em>&rsquo; did take place, and that
too in beds, perfectly disjointed from every wall,
was obvious to our senses; though in what way
they were occasioned could not be developed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again&mdash;our attention was directed at different
times during the night to certain sounds on the
bed&rsquo;s-head and walls, resembling the scratchings
of two or three fingers; but in <em>no</em> instance were
they &lsquo;<em>the clawing of a voracious animal after its
prey</em>.&rsquo; During the night I happened to leave the
spot in which the party were assembled, and to
wander in the dark to some more distant rooms in
the house, occupied by no one member of the family
(but where the disturbances originally arose), and
there, to my astonishment, the same scratchings
were to be heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At another time, also, when one of Mr. Stewart&rsquo;s
children was requested to hum a lively air, &lsquo;<em>most
scientific beatings</em>&rsquo; to every note was distinctly
heard from the bed-head; and at its close, &lsquo;<em>four
blows</em>&rsquo; were given, louder (I think) and more rapid
than any which had before occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither ought I to omit that, at the commencement
of the noises, several feeble &lsquo;<em>moans</em>&rsquo; were
heard. This happened more than once; after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
time they increased to a series of &lsquo;<em>groanings</em>&rsquo;
of a peculiarly distressing character, and proceeding
(as it seemed) from the bed of one of Mr. Stewart&rsquo;s
children, about ten years of age. From the tone
of voice, as well as other circumstances, my own
conviction is, that these &lsquo;<em>moans</em>&rsquo; could not arise
from any effort on the part of the child. Perhaps
there were others present who might have had
different impressions; but be this as it may,
towards daybreak four or six shrieks were heard&mdash;not
from any bed or wall, but as hovering in the
atmosphere in the room, where the other noises had
been principally heard. These screams were distinctly
heard by <em>all</em>, but their cause was discoverable
by <em>none</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These, Sir, are the chief events which occurred at
Syderstone Parsonage on the night alluded to in your
paragraph. I understand the &lsquo;<em>knockings</em>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<em>sounds</em>&rsquo; have varied considerably in their character
on different nights, and that there have been
several nights occurring (at four distinct periods)
in which <em>no noises</em> have been heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have simply related what took place under my
own observation. You will perceive that the noises
heard by us were by no means so loud and violent
as would be gathered from the representations
which have been made. Still, as you are aware,
they are not on that account the less real; nor do
they, on that account, require the less rational
explanation. I trust, however, Mr. Editor, your
readers will fully understand me. I have not
related the occurrences of the night for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of leading them to any particular views, or conclusions
upon a subject which, for the present at
least, is wrapt in obscurity: such is very remote from
my object. But Mr. Stewart having requested me,
as a neighbouring clergyman, to witness the inconveniences
and interruptions to which the different
members of his family have been subject for the
last sixteen weeks, I have felt it my duty, as an
honest man (particularly among the false statements
now abroad) to bear my feeble testimony, however
inconsiderable it may be, to their actual existence
in his house; and also since, from the very nature of
the case, it is not possible Mr. Stewart can admit
the repeated introduction of strangers to his family,
I have thought it likewise a duty I owed to the
public to place before them the circumstances which
really did take place on that occasion. In the
words of your paragraph, I can truly say: &lsquo;<em>I had a
variety of thoughts and explanations passing in my
mind before I was on the spot, but I left it perfectly
bewildered</em>,&rsquo; and I must confess the perplexity
has not been diminished by the result of an investigation,
which was most carefully pursued for
five days, during the past week, under the immediate
direction of Mr. Reeve, of Houghton, agent to the
Marquis of Cholmondeley, the proprietor of Syderstone
and patron of the Rectory, and who, on
learning the annoyances to which Mr. Stewart was
subject, directed every practicable aid to be afforded
for the purpose of discovery. Mr. Seppings and
Mr. Savory, the two chief inhabitants of the parish,
assisted also in the investigation. A &lsquo;<em>trench</em>&rsquo; was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
dug round the back part of the house, and
&lsquo;<em>borings</em>&rsquo; were resorted to in all other parts of it
to the depth of six or seven feet, completing a
chain round the entire buildings, for the purpose of
discovering any subterranean communication with
the walls, which might possibly explain the noises
in question. Many parts of the interior of the
house, also, such as &lsquo;<em>the walls</em>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<em>floors</em>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<em>false
roofs</em>,&rsquo; etc., have been minutely examined, but
nothing has been found to throw any light upon the
source of the disturbances. Indeed, I understand
the &lsquo;<em>knockings</em>&rsquo; within the last four days, so far
from having subsided, are become increasingly
distressing to Mr. Stewart and his family&mdash;and so
<em>remain</em>!&mdash;I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="dat2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Norwich</span>, <i>June 5, 1833</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The detail of circumstances connected
with the <cite>Syderstone Ghost</cite>, as reported in the public
papers, is in my opinion very incorrect, and calculated
to deceive the public. If the report of
noises heard on other evenings be as much exaggerated
as in the report of the noises which five
other gentlemen and myself heard on Wednesday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
evening, the 15th of May, nothing could be better
contrived to foster superstition and to aid deception.
I was spending a few days with a friend in
the neighbourhood of Syderstone, and was courteously
invited by Mr. Stewart to sit up at the
Parsonage; but I never imagined the noises I heard
during the night would become a subject of general
conversation in our city and county. As such is
the case, and as I have been so frequently appealed
to by personal friends, I hope you will afford the
convenience of correcting, through the medium of
your journal, some of the errors committed in the
reports made of the disturbances which occurred
when I was present. If the other visitors thought
proper to make their statements known to the
public, I have no doubt they would nearly accord
with my own, as we are not, though so represented
in the <cite>Bury Post</cite>, &lsquo;those who deal in contradictions
of this sort.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The noises were <em>not loud</em>; certainly they were
not so loud as to be heard by those ladies and
gentlemen who were sitting at the time of their
commencement in a bedroom only a few yards
distant. The noises commenced as nearly as
possible at the hour we had been prepared to expect
they would&mdash;or at about half-past one o&rsquo;clock a.m.
It is true that knocks seemed to be given, or actually
were given, on the side-board of a bed whilst Mr.
Goggs&rsquo; hands were upon it; but it is not true that
they were &lsquo;powerful knocks.&rsquo; It is also true that
Mr. Goggs requested the ghost, if he could not
speak, to give three knocks, and that three knocks&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>gentle
knocks, not &lsquo;three most tremendous blows&rsquo;&mdash;were
heard as proceeding from the thin wall against
which were the beds of the children and the female
servants. I heard a scream as of a female, but I
was not alarmed; I cannot speak <em>positively</em> as to
the origin of the scream, but I cannot deny that
such a scream may be produced by a ventriloquist.
The family are highly respectable, and I know not
any good reason for a suspicion to be excited against
any one of the members; but as it is <em>possible</em> for
one or two members of a family to cause disturbances
to the rest, I must confess that I should be more
satisfied that there is not a connection between
the ghost and a member of the family if the noises
were distinctly heard in the rooms when <em>all</em> the
members of the family were known to be at a
distance from them. I understood from Mr.
Stewart that on one occasion the whole family&mdash;himself,
Mrs. Stewart, the children, and servants&mdash;sat
up in his bedroom during the night; that himself
and Mrs. Stewart kept an attentive watch upon
the children and servants; and that the noises,
though seldom or never heard before in that room,
were then heard in all parts of the room. This
fact, though not yet accounted for, is not a proof
but that some one or more of the family is able to
give full information of the cause of the noises.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Stewart and other gentlemen declared that
they have heard such loud and violent knocking,
and other strange noises, as certainly throw a
great mystery over the circumstance. I speak
only in reference to the knockings and the scream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
which I heard when in company with the gentlemen
whose names have been already made known to
the public; and confining my remarks to those
noises, I hesitate not to declare that I think similar
noises might be caused by visible and internal
agency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not deny the existence of supernatural
agency, or of its occasional manifestation; but I
firmly believe such a manifestation does not take
place without Divine permission, and when permitted
it is not for trifling purposes, nor accompanied
with <em>trifling effects</em>. Now there are effects
which appear to me <em>trifling</em>, connected with the
noises at Syderstone, and which therefore tend
to satisfy my mind that they are <em>not caused by
supernatural agency</em>. On one occasion the ghost
was desired to give ten knocks; he gave nine,
and, as if recollecting himself that the number was
not completed, he began again, and gave ten. I
heard him beat time to the air of the verse
of a song sung by Miss Stewart&mdash;if I mistake not,
&lsquo;Home, Sweet Home&rsquo;; and I heard him give three
knocks in compliance with Mr. Goggs&rsquo; request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Editor, noises are heard in Syderstone Parsonage
the cause or agency of which is at present
unknown to the public, but a full, a diligent investigation
ought <em>immediately</em> to be made&mdash;Mr.
Stewart, I believe, is willing to afford facility. If,
therefore, I may express an opinion, that if two or
three active and experienced police officers from
Norwich were permitted to be the sole occupants
in the house for a few nights, the ghost would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
interrupt their slumbers, or, if he attempted to do
it, they would quickly find him out, and teach him
better manners for the future. The disturbances
at the Parsonage House, Epworth, in 1716, in some
particulars resemble those which have occurred
at Syderstone, but in these days we give little
credit to tales of witchcraft, or that evil spirits are
permitted to indicate their displeasure at prayers
being offered for the King, etc.; and therefore I
hope that deceptions practised at Syderstone, if
there be deceptions, will be promptly discovered,
lest that parsonage become equal in repute to the
one at Epworth.&mdash;I am, Sir, your humble servant,</p>

<p class="sal1">&ldquo;<i>To the Editor of the Norfolk Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Having already borne my testimony to
the occurrences of the night of the 15th ult. in the
Parsonage at Syderstone, and finding that <em>ventriloquism
and other devices</em> are now resorted to as the
probable causes of them (and that, too, under the
sanction of certain statements put forth in your
last week&rsquo;s paper), I feel myself called on to state
publicly that, although a diligent observer of the
different events which then took place, I witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
no one circumstance which could induce <em>me</em> to
indulge a conjecture that the <em>knocks</em>, <em>vibrations</em>,
<em>scratchings</em>, <em>groanings</em> etc., which I heard, proceeded
from any member of Mr. Stewart&rsquo;s family, through
the medium of mechanical or other trickery:&mdash;indeed,
it would seem to me utterly impossible that
the scratchings which fell under my observation
during the night, in a remote room of the house,
could be so produced, as, at that time, every
member of Mr. Stewart&rsquo;s family was removed a
considerable distance from the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While making this declaration, I beg to state
that my only object in bearing any part in this
mysterious affair has been to investigate and to
elicit the <em>truth</em>. I have ever desired to approach
it without <em>prejudging</em> it&mdash;that is, with a mind
willing to be influenced by <em>facts</em> alone,&mdash;without
any inclination to establish either the intervention of
<em>human</em> agency on the one hand, or of <em>super-human</em>
agency on the other hand:&mdash;at the same time, it is
but common honesty to state that Mr. Stewart
expresses himself so fully conscious of his own
integrity towards the public that he has resolved on
suffering all the imputations and reflections which
<em>have</em> been or which may be cast either upon himself
or upon his family to pass without remark; and
as he has, at different times and upon different
occasions, so fully satisfied his own mind on the
<em>impossibility</em> of the disturbances in question arising
from the agency of any member of his own household
(and from the incessant research he has made
on this point, he himself must be the best judge),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Mr. Stewart intends declining all future interruptions
of his family, by the interference of
strangers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Mr. Editor, your distant readers may
not be aware that Mr. Stewart has not been resident
at Syderstone more than fourteen months, while
mysterious noises are <em>now</em> proved to have been
heard in this house, at different intervals and in
different degrees of violence, for the last thirty years
and upwards. Most conclusive and satisfactory
affidavits on this point are now in progress, of the
completion of which you shall have notice in due
time.&mdash;I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the information of the public, as well as for
the protection of the family now occupying the above

the subjoined documents have been prepared.
These documents, it was proposed, should appear
before the public as Affidavits, but a question
of law having arisen as to the authority of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Magistrates to receive Affidavits on subjects of this
nature, the Declarations hereunder furnished have
been adopted in their stead. The witnesses whose
testimony is afforded have been all separately
examined&mdash;their statements, in every instance,
have been most cheerfully afforded&mdash;and the
solemn impression under which the evidence of
some of them particularly has been recorded, has
served to show how deeply the events in question
have been fixed in their recollection. Without
entering upon the question of Causes, one Fact,
it is presumed, must be obvious to all (namely):
That various inexplicable noises have been heard
in the above residence, at different intervals, and
in different degrees of violence, for many years
before the present occupiers ever entered upon it:
indeed, the Testimony of other respectable persons
to this Fact might have been easily adduced, but it
is not likely that any who are disposed to reject or
question the subjoined evidence would be influenced
by any additional Testimony which could be
presented:&mdash;</p>

of Mrs. Mantle&rsquo;s sister having either seen or heard
something very unusual, in one of the sleeping
rooms over the kitchen, which had greatly terrified
her.&mdash;This Declaration was made and signed this

<p>&ldquo;<i>Elizabeth</i>, the wife of George <i>Parsons</i>, of Syderstone,
in the county of Norfolk, blacksmith, now
voluntarily declareth, and is prepared at any time
to confirm the same on oath, and say: That she
married about nineteen years ago, and then entered
upon the occupation of the south end of the
Parsonage at Syderstone, in which house she continued
to reside for the space of nine years and a
half. That she, the said Elizabeth Parsons, having
lived at Fakenham previously to her marriage,
was ignorant of the reputed circumstances of
noises being heard in the said house, and continued
so for about nine or ten months after entering
upon it; but that, at the end of that time, upon
one occasion during the night, she remembers to
have been awoke by some &lsquo;very violent and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
rapid knocks&rsquo; in the lower room occupied by
them, immediately under the chamber in which
she was sleeping; that the noise appeared to her
to be as against the stove which she supposed
must have been broken to pieces; That she, the
said Elizabeth Parsons, awoke her husband, who
instantly heard the same noise; that he immediately
arose, struck a light, and went downstairs;
but that, upon entering the room, he found everything
perfectly safe, as they had been left upon
their going to bed; that her husband hereupon
returned to the sleeping room, put out the light,
and went to bed; but scarcely had he settled
himself in bed, before the same heavy blows returned;
and were heard by both of them for a
considerable time.&mdash;This being the first of the
noises she, the said Elizabeth Parsons, ever heard,
she was greatly alarmed, and requested her husband
not to go to sleep while they lasted, lest she should
die from fear; but as to the causes of these noises,
she, the said Elizabeth Parsons, cannot, in anywise,
account. And the said Elizabeth Parsons
further states, that about a year afterwards at
midnight, during one of her confinements, her
attention was particularly called to some strange
noises heard from the lower room. These noises
were very violent, and, as much as she remembers,
were like the opening and tossing up and down
of the sashes, the bursting of the shutters, and
the crashing of the chairs placed at the windows:
that her nurse hereupon went downstairs to
examine the state of the room, but, to the surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of all, found everything perfectly in order, as she
had left it.&mdash;And likewise the said Elizabeth
Parsons further states, that besides the occurrences
hereinbefore particularly stated and which remain
quite fresh in her recollection, she was, from time
to time, during her residence in Syderstone Parsonage,
constantly interrupted by very frightful and
unusual knockings, various and irregular;&mdash;sometimes
they were heard in one part of the house,
and sometimes in another;&mdash;sometimes they were
frequent, and sometimes two or three weeks or
months or even twelve months would pass, without
any knock being heard. That these knocks were
usually never given till the family were all at rest
at night, and she has frequently remarked, just at
the time she hoped she had got rid of them, they
returned to the house, with increased violence.&mdash;And
finally the said Elizabeth Parsons declares,
that during a residence in the Syderstone Parsonage
of upwards of nine years, knocks and noises were
heard by her therein, for which she was utterly
unable to assign any cause.&mdash;This Declaration was

is prepared at any time to confirm the same on
oath, and say: That one night, about eleven years
ago, while Mr. George Parsons occupied part of
the Parsonage at Syderstone, he happened to be
sleeping in the attic there; and about midnight
he heard (he thinks he was awoke out of sleep) a
dreadful noise, like the sudden and heavy fall of
part of the chimney upon the stove in the lower
sitting-room.&mdash;That the crash was so great that,
although at a considerable distance from the
spot, he distinctly heard the noise, not doubting
the chimney had fallen and dashed the stove to
pieces:&mdash;that he arose and went downstairs (it
being a light summer&rsquo;s night): but upon examining
the state of the room and stove, he found, to his
astonishment, everything as it ought to have been.
And the said Thomas Mase further states, that,
upon another occasion, about eight or nine years
ago, while sleeping a night in Syderstone Parsonage
in a room at the south end thereof, the door of
which room moved particularly hard upon the
floor, requiring to be lifted up in order to close or
open it, and producing a particular sound in its
movement, he distinctly heard all the sounds which
accompanied its opening.&mdash;That he felt certain
the door was opened, and arose from his bed to
shut it, but, to his great surprise, he found the
door closed, just as he had left it.&mdash;And finally the
said Thomas Mase states, that the circumstances
above related, arose from causes which he is totally
at a loss to explain.&mdash;This Declaration was made

years ago, at which time his said master entered
upon the occupation of the Parsonage at Syderstone,
and that he continued with him during his
residence in that place. The said William Ofield
also states, that, as he did not sleep in the house,
he knows but little of what took place therein
during the night, but that he perfectly remembers,
on one occasion, while sitting in the kitchen, he
heard in the bedroom immediately over his head,
a noise resembling the dragging of furniture about
the room, accompanied with the fall as of some very
heavy substance upon the floor.&mdash;That he is certain
this noise did take place, and verily believes no one
member of the family was in the room at the time.&mdash;The
said William Ofield likewise states, that the
noise was loud enough to alarm part of the family
then sitting in the lower room, in the opposite extremity
of the house; that he is quite sure they
were alarmed, inasmuch as one of the ladies immediately
hastened to the kitchen to make inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
about the noise, though his said master&rsquo;s family
never seemed desirous of making much of these
occurrences:&mdash;that he, the said Wm. Ofield, was
ordered to go upstairs to see what had happened,
and upon entering the room he found everything
right:&mdash;he has no hesitation in declaring that this
noise was not occasioned by any person in the
house. The said Wm. Ofield likewise states, that,
at different times during the evenings, while he was
in his said master&rsquo;s service, he has heard other
strange noises about the house, which he could
never account for, particularly the rattling of glass
and china in the chiffonier standing in the drawing-room,
as if a cat were running in the midst of them,
while he well believes no cat could be there, as the
door was locked. And the said Wm. Ofield likewise
states, that he has been requested by some of
the female servants of the family, who had been
frightened, to search the false roof of the house, and
to quiet their alarms, he has done so, but could
never discover anything out of order.&mdash;This Declaration

to confirm the same on oath, and say: That she
entered the service of the Rev. Thomas Skrimshire,
at Syderstone Parsonage, about seven years ago,
and continued with him about four years; that in
the last year of her service with Mr. Skrimshire,
about Christmas-time, while sitting by the kitchen
fireside, she heard a noise resembling the moving
and rattling of the chairs about the sleeping rooms
immediately over her;&mdash;that the noise was so great
that one of Mr. Skrimshire&rsquo;s daughters came out of
the drawing-room (which was removed a considerable
distance from the spot in which the noise was
heard) to make inquiry about it: that the manservant
and part of the family immediately went
upstairs, but found nothing displaced;&mdash;and moreover
that she verily believes no member of the
family was upstairs at the time.&mdash;The said Elizabeth
Hooks also states, that, upon another occasion,
after the above event, as she was going up the attic
stairs to bed, with her fellow-servant, about eleven
o&rsquo;clock at night, she heard three very loud and distinct
knocks, as coming from the door of the false
roof. These knocks were also heard by the ladies
of the family, then separating for the night, who
tried to persuade her it was someone knocking at
the hall door. The said Elizabeth Hooks says,
that although convinced it was from no person
out doors, yet she opened the casement to look
and, as she expected, found no one;&mdash;indeed (being
closest to the spot on which the blows were struck)
she is sure they were on the door, but how and by
whom given she is quite at a loss to conjecture.&mdash;And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
finally the said Elizabeth Hooks states, that
at another time, after she had got into her sleeping-room
(the whole family besides being in bed, and
she herself sitting up working at her needle) she
heard noises in the passage leading to the room,
like a person walking with a peculiar hop: that she
was alarmed, and verily believes it was not occasioned

oath, and say: That about twenty years ago, a
few days after Michaelmas, she was left in charge
of Syderstone Parsonage, then occupied by Mr.
Henry Crafer; and about eight o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, while sitting in the kitchen, after securing
all the doors, and no other person being in the
house, she heard great noises in the sleeping rooms
over her head, as of persons &lsquo;running out of one
room into another&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;stumping about very loud&rsquo;&mdash;and
that these noises continued about ten
minutes or a quarter of an hour:&mdash;that she felt the
more alarmed, being satisfied there was, at that
time, no one but herself in the house.&mdash;And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
said Phoebe Steward further states, that on
Whitsun-Tuesday, eighteen years ago, she was
called to attend, as nurse, on Mrs. Elizabeth Parsons,
in one of her confinements, then living in Syderstone
Parsonage:&mdash;That about a fortnight after that
time, one night, about twelve o&rsquo;clock, having just
got her patient to bed, she remembers to have
plainly heard the footsteps, as of someone walking
from their sleeping-room door, down the stairs,
step by step, to the door of the sitting-room below:&mdash;that
she distinctly heard the sitting-room door
open, and the chair placed near one of the windows
moved; and the shutters opened. All this the
said Phoebe Steward is quite sure she distinctly
heard, and thereupon immediately, on being
desired, she came downstairs, in company with
another female, whom she had awakened to go
with her, being too much alarmed to go by herself:
but on entering the room she found everything
just as she had left it.&mdash;And the said Phoebe
Steward further states, that about a fortnight
after the last-named event, while sleeping on a
bureau bedstead in one of the lower rooms in
Syderstone Parsonage,&mdash;that is, in the room referred
to in the last statement,&mdash;she heard &lsquo;a very surprising
and frightful knock, as if it had struck the
head of the bed and dashed it in pieces&rsquo;: that
this knock was so violent as to be heard by Mrs.
Crafer in the centre of the house:&mdash;that she, the
said Phoebe Steward, and another person who
was at that time sleeping with her, were very much
alarmed with this heavy blow, and never knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
how to account for it. And finally, the said Phoebe
Steward states, that, during the forty-five years
she has been in the habit of frequenting the
Syderstone Parsonage (without referring to any
extraordinary statements she has heard from her
sister, now dead, and others who have resided in
it), that she, from her own positive experience,

noises do exist which have never been attempted

he has lived in the capacity of shepherd with Mr.
Thomas Seppings, and that one night in the early
part of March 1832, between the hours of ten and
eleven o&rsquo;clock, as he was passing behind the Parsonage
at Syderstone in a pathway across the glebe land near
the house, when within about twelve yards of the
back part of the buildings, his attention was
arrested all on a sudden by some very loud &lsquo;groanings,&rsquo;
like those &lsquo;of a dying man&mdash;solemn and
lamentable,&rsquo; coming as it seemed to him from the
centre of the house above:&mdash;that the said Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Hunter is satisfied these groans had but then just
begun, otherwise he must have heard them long
before he approached so near the house.&mdash;He also
further states, that he was much alarmed at these
groans, knowing particularly that the Parsonage
at that time was wholly unoccupied, it being about
a month before Mr. Stewart&rsquo;s family came into
residence there:&mdash;that these groans made such an
impression upon his mind, as he shall never lose,
to his dying hour. And the said Robert Hunter
likewise states, that, after stopping for a season
near the house, and satisfying himself of the reality
of these groans, he passed on his way, and continued
to hear them as he walked, for the distance of not
less than 100 yards. The said Robert Hunter
knows 100 yards is a great way, yet if he had stopped
and listened, he, the said Robert Hunter, doubts
not he could have heard them to a still greater
distance than 100 yards: &lsquo;so loud and so fearful
were they, that never did he hear the like before.&rsquo;&mdash;This
Declaration was made and signed this 19th
day of June 1833, before me, Derick Hoste, one of
His Majesty&rsquo;s Justices of the Peace for the County
of Norfolk.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a><span class="g">CHAPTER XI</span><br />
<br />
THE GREEN VAPOUR</h2>



<p><span class="smcap">Near</span> Bournemouth there is a house called the
Caspar Beeches that never lets for any length
of time. It has a very remarkable history, which,
in the words of Mr. Mark Wildbridge, I now append.
(Mr. Mark Wildbridge, by the way, was a clever
amateur detective who died about the middle of
last century, and many of his experiences, including
the following, were narrated to me by one of his
descendants.)</p>

<p>I had been attending to some newly planted
shrubs in my garden, and was crossing the lawn on
my way to the back premises to wash my hands,
when the gate was swung open vigorously and a
voice called out, &ldquo;Can you tell me if Mr. Mark
Wildbridge lives here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at the speaker. He was a tall young
man, slim and clean built, obviously an athlete,
a public schoolman, and very much the gentleman.</p>

<p>I was by no means in the mood to receive
strangers, but as his type especially appeals to me,
I decided to be gracious to him. &ldquo;I am Mark
Wildbridge,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Can I be of any service
to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you Mr. Wildbridge?&rdquo; the young man
said in astonishment. &ldquo;Somehow I had formed
such a different picture of you. But, of course,
there is no reason why a detective should carry his
trade in his face any more than an artist or author.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather less reason, perhaps,&rdquo; I responded
dryly. &ldquo;Have you come to consult me professionally?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;May I speak to you in private, somewhere where
there is no chance of our being overheard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I conducted him to my study, and, after seeing
him seated, begged him to proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wildbridge,&rdquo; he began, leaning forward
and eyeing me intently, &ldquo;do you believe in family
curses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It depends,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I have come across cases
where there seems little doubt a family is labouring
under some malign superphysical influence. But
why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For this reason,&rdquo; he replied, sitting up straight
and assuming an expression of great intensity.
&ldquo;Two years ago I was living with my parents
at the Caspar Beeches, near Bournemouth. My
brother was coming home from India on sick
leave, and my father and I had gone up to town to
meet him, when, the day after we arrived, we got
a wire to say that my mother had died suddenly.
She had been absolutely well when we left her, so
that the shock, as you may imagine, was terrible.
Of course we hastened home at once, but the news
was only too true&mdash;she was dead, and, at the inquest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which followed in due course, a verdict of death
from asphyxiation&mdash;cause unknown&mdash;was returned.
Well, Mr. Wildbridge, exactly six months later my
father was also found dead in his bedroom, and,
as everything pointed to his having died in exactly
the same manner as my mother, my brother and I
had a detective down from Scotland Yard to
inquire into the affair. He could, however, make
nothing of it. The door of my father&rsquo;s room was
found locked on the inside, the windows were all
fastened, so that no one could have gained admission;
and, besides, as nothing had been touched,
and not a single article was missing, there was no
apparent motive for a crime. At the same time, my
brother and I were far from satisfied. Although,
as the detective had pointed out to us, my father
was alone when he met his death, it seemed to us
that his end must have been brought about by
some unnatural and outside agency. The coroner&rsquo;s
verdict was death from asphyxiation, the medical
evidence tending to show that he had died from
the effects of some poisonous gas. Yet whence
came the gas and how was it administered? The
sanitary authorities, whom we called in, declared,
after a very careful examination, that all the
drains were in the most excellent repair, so we
simply didn&rsquo;t know what to think. My brother,
who had imbibed mysticism in India, at length
came to the conclusion that there was some curse
on us. He said that my father had on several
occasions spoken very gloomily about the parents&rsquo;
sins being visited on their children, and I, too, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
noticed that my father at times was very despondent;
but I had attributed this despondency merely
to moodiness, and at the time pooh-poohed my
brother&rsquo;s suggestion that there existed a mystery&mdash;something
sinister in connection with some member
of our own family. But since then I have altered
my opinion, for my brother, who inherited the property,
has also been found dead&mdash;killed by the
same diabolical agency that for some unknown
reason brought about the deaths of my mother and
father. The Caspar Beeches is now mine, Mr.
Wildbridge, and I have come to ask you what I
had better do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think, of course, that you may share the
fate of your mother, father, and brother?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it extremely likely,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the only one left in your family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the only one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are your plans with regard to the
Caspar Beeches?&rdquo; I inquired. &ldquo;Do you think
of residing there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;that is one of the points upon which I want your
advice. I want to know what you think about
these deaths. Do you think they were due to
some as yet undiscovered physical cause, as, for
instance, some unknown disease, or some gas the
sanitary authorities have not been able to trace&mdash;or,
to the superphysical?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can form no opinion at present,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;I must first have more details. But from what
you have said, I think this case presents some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
novel and very extraordinary features. I should
like to see the house. By the way, you haven&rsquo;t
told me your name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mansfield,&rdquo; the young man said&mdash;&ldquo;Eldred
Mansfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The son of Sir Thomas Mansfield, the Bornean
explorer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are the present baronet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in the event of your death,&rdquo; I remarked,
&ldquo;to whom do the title and estates revert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe to some distant relative,&rdquo; Sir Eldred
replied. &ldquo;I cannot say definitely, for I have never
inquired. I have no first cousins, and I know nothing
about any others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is rather odd,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;not to
know who succeeds you. Now, tell me&mdash;of whom
does your household at the Caspar Beeches
consist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The butler Parry, his wife, who is housekeeper,
and four other servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the Parrys been with you long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About four years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not altogether,&rdquo; Sir Eldred replied. &ldquo;Parry is
rather fussy and officious, and his wife much too
soapy. My father, however, found them honest, and
I don&rsquo;t suppose I could improve on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as I have already remarked,
I can&rsquo;t give you an opinion till I&rsquo;ve seen the house.
Supposing you engage me as your secretary?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;An excellent idea,&rdquo; Sir Eldred cried, his face
lighting with enthusiasm. &ldquo;To tell the truth, I
don&rsquo;t much like the idea of sleeping there alone.
Will you go back with me to-night? I will wire
to Parry to get a room ready for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As my time was my own just then, I agreed,
and that afternoon saw me tearing off in a taxi to
meet Sir Eldred at Waterloo.</p>

<p>The Caspar Beeches, a large old family mansion,
is situated nearer Winton than Bournemouth
proper, and in the midst of the most lovely forest
scenery. An air of impressive sadness hung around
it, which, although no doubt largely due to the
season and lateness of the hour, still, I thought,
owed its origin, in part, to some very different
cause; and when, on entering, I glanced round
the big, gloomy, oak-panelled hall with its dim,
far-reaching galleries, I inwardly remarked that
this might well be the home of a dozen hidden
mysteries, a dozen lurking assassins, that could
prowl about and hide there, without the remotest
fear of discovery.</p>

<p>The door had been opened to us by a tall, thin,
bald-headed old man, with small and rather deep-set
eyes of the most pronounced blue, and a rather
cut-away chin. He expressed himself overjoyed to
see his young master back again, and was most
emphatic in his assurances that our rooms were
quite ready for us.</p>

<p>His wife, an elderly woman with dark, keen,
penetrating eyes and slightly prominent cheekbones,
met us in the hall. I knew, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
that she was Mrs. Parry, when she spoke, but her
voice came as a surprise. In striking contrast
to her appearance it was soft and low, and not
altogether unmusical. The other servants did not
interest me much&mdash;they were the type one sees
in all well-to-do establishments&mdash;and yet I felt that
if I were to get at the bottom of the mystery
that unquestionably shrouded the deaths of Sir
Eldred&rsquo;s three relatives, I must watch everyone
very closely; for the key to a great secret is often
found where least expected.</p>

<p>We dined at eight o&rsquo;clock, and after dinner I
took a brief survey of the house. This enabled
me to form some idea of the general arrangement
of the rooms and where certain of them were
situated. My bedroom, I found, was separated
from that of Sir Eldred by the entire length of a
corridor, and at my suggestion the room adjoining
his own was allotted to me instead. Mrs. Parry
demurred a little at the change, remarking that
the room next Sir Eldred&rsquo;s had not been aired;
but I told her I was not in the least degree likely
to catch cold, as I had often slept in queer places,
having spent a considerable portion of my life in
the backwoods of Canada. Sir Eldred laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what care we are taken of
here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can assure you, if I were to
feel even the suspicion of a draught it would be
considered a most terrible calamity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Mrs. Parry said, with a sigh,
&ldquo;after what has happened, Sir Eldred&rsquo;s life is so
precious we feel we cannot be too careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea what killed your late
master and mistress?&rdquo; I asked her aside. &ldquo;What
terrible times you have gone through!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, terrible indeed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A kinder
master and mistress no one could have had. Parry
and I always thought something blew in from
outside. There is too much vegetation in the
grounds, and it grows so near the house. They do
say the place is built on the site of a morass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A morass, and in Hampshire!&rdquo; I laughed.
&ldquo;Why, that sounds incredible. The soil is surely
gravel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it may be&mdash;now,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking
of many years ago. The house is very ancient,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked Sir Eldred afterwards if there was any
truth in her remark, and he said, &ldquo;Yes, I believe
there was a swamp here once; at least there is
mention of one in a very old history of Hampshire
that we have in the library. It was drawn off
towards the end of the sixteenth century when
the house was built. But I&rsquo;m surprised at the
Parrys knowing anything about it, for I&rsquo;ve never
heard anyone allude to it&mdash;not even my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the Parrys of the ordinary servant class?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; Sir Eldred replied; &ldquo;but I really
know nothing of their antecedents, for I seldom
encourage them to speak. As I told you, they both
rather get on my nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, some hours after the household had
retired to rest, I took a rope out of my portmanteau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and, fixing one end of it securely to the bedstead,
lowered myself out of the window on to the ground
beneath. Then, keeping under cover of the pine
trees, and evading the moonbeams as much as
possible, I made a detour of the house. The night
air smelt pure and sweet. Heavily charged with
the scent of pinewood and heather, there was
absolutely nothing about it even remotely suggestive
of poisonous gas.</p>

<p>As I was about to emerge from the trees to re-enter
the house, I heard a slight crunching sound
on the gravel. I sprang back again into the gloom,
and as I did so, two figures&mdash;a man and girl&mdash;stole
noiselessly past me.</p>

<p>The girl I could not see distinctly, as her head
was partly enveloped in a cloak, but the face of the
man stood out very plainly in the moonlight&mdash;it
was the face of a black!</p>

<p>What could a black man and a young girl be doing
prowling about the grounds of the Caspar Beeches
at that hour of night? Who were they?</p>

<p>I did not say a word to anyone, but the following
night&mdash;at the same hour&mdash;I again hid amongst
the trees, and the same figures passed me. Then I
stole out of my lair and followed them.</p>

<p>On quitting the premises they took the high road
to Bournemouth, and finally entered a house in
the Holdenhurst Road. Making a mental note of
the number of the house, I retraced my steps homeward,
and early the next morning I sent the following
telegram to Vane, who often accompanies me on my
expeditions, and to whose quick wits I owe much:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;Have an important case on hand. Meet me
this evening entrance to Bournemouth pier 7 p.m.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>After dispatching this telegram I returned to
the Beeches, and asked Sir Eldred to show me the
rooms in which the three deaths had taken place.
I then examined these rooms most minutely, but
I could discover nothing in them that could in
any way help me to form a theory or even get a
suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When were the deaths first discovered?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until the morning,&rdquo; Sir Eldred replied,
&ldquo;when the servants, getting no reply to their
knocks, became alarmed, and eventually the doors
were forced open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in each case death had taken place in
bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have the same doctor to all three of
your relatives after their deaths had been discovered?&rdquo;
I asked Sir Eldred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dr. Bowles. He has attended
us for years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What age is he?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>Sir Eldred thought a moment. &ldquo;About sixty-four
or five,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He attended my father
long before he was married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he would be a little old-fashioned,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;He might not, for instance, have much
knowledge of the newest poisons. New poisons,
you know, both in the form of liquid and gases, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
constantly being discovered. Many are imported
from Germany and the East. Might I see Dr.
Bowles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Sir Eldred replied; &ldquo;but I fear he
cannot help you much, as all he knew he made
public at the inquests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Eldred was right practically. In my interview
with Dr. Bowles, I found that he could tell
me little beyond what I already knew. &ldquo;Can you,&rdquo;
I asked him, &ldquo;describe the appearance of the
bodies and the effect on them of the gas which you
say, in all probability, caused the asphyxiation?
Was there anything specially remarkable in the
facial contractions or colour of the skin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there was an infinite horror,
such horror as I have never seen in human faces
before,&rdquo; and he shuddered as he spoke. Then he
gave me a minute description of the bodies, which
I took down in my notebook and posted to a
specialist in Oriental poisons whom I knew in
London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there nothing else in the three cases that
struck you as unusual?&rdquo; I asked Dr. Bowles.
&ldquo;No peculiarity in common?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, and then said, &ldquo;Nothing
beyond the fact that all three died precisely at the
same time&mdash;ten minutes past two in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The time when human vitality is at the lowest,
and superphysical phenomena the most common.
Were the victims in a normal state of health?
Was there any family or hereditary disease?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, valvular weakness of the heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Which would render them more susceptible to
the influence of poison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poison and shock. The inhalation of certain
poisons has a particularly deadly effect on people
suffering from cardiac defection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could the poison have been self-inflicted?
Are people suffering with such a disease prone to
suicide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only, as a rule, when the disease is in a very
advanced state&mdash;you then get delirium, hallucinations,
and morbid impulses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And none of these symptoms were noticeable
in the deceased?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in a sufficiently marked degree to warrant
the suggestion of suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no theory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;and yet I&rsquo;m sorry to say I can&rsquo;t help
feeling there is something very sinister about it all&mdash;something
that bodes ill for Sir Eldred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much disappointed, I returned to the Caspar
Beeches, and was making another inspection of
the room in which one of the tragedies had occurred
when, chancing to glance at the mirror over the
mantelshelf, I caught the reflection of a pair of dark
eyes fixed inquiringly at me. I looked round, and
a figure passed along the passage. It was Mrs.
Parry. She had evidently been peeping at me
through the slightly open door, which I could have
sworn I had closed. This made me careful. If I
meant to unravel this mystery, I must on no account
be seen doing anything that might arouse suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
as to my real identity. Hence I determined to
confine myself more to the study in future, and the
rest of the morning I spent taking down in shorthand
letters which Sir Eldred dictated. Walls
have ears, and the sound of Sir Eldred dictating to
me, I argued, might prove convincing.</p>

<p>A week passed and I discovered nothing. There
was nothing in the demeanour of any of the servants
to give me the slightest reason for suspecting them;
if any of them were &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; they kept
their secret absolutely to themselves. At night,
as soon as I deemed it safe, I slipped on a pair of
rubber shoes and crept about the house and grounds,
but with no result. On the morning of the eighth
day I received two letters&mdash;one from Vane, who had
taken furnished apartments next door to the house
I had noted in the Holdenhurst Road, and the
other from Craddock, the poison specialist.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I have at last found out something about those
two people,&rdquo; Vane wrote. &ldquo;They call themselves
Effie and George Tyson. Tyson is an assumed
name; the girl is the daughter of Parry, Sir Eldred&rsquo;s
butler, and the man is Henry Mansfield, nephew of
Sir Thomas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; I could not help exclaiming.
&ldquo;This is news indeed. Sir Eldred assured me that
he had no very near relatives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their bedroom is only separated from mine,&rdquo;
the letter went on, &ldquo;by a very thin wall, and when
I had removed a brick I could catch every word
they said. There&rsquo;s some mystery, and I&rsquo;m going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to try and solve it for you. Watch at the Beeches.
I believe there is something extra in the wind.
Effie has been there already this morning, and she
and George are both going there again late this
evening.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The other letter, from Craddock, was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one gas that produces all the
effects you describe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that has certainly
been hitherto unknown in England; indeed,
the knowledge of it has been strictly confined to
one region&mdash;a district in the south-east of Borneo.
The natives there worship a great spirit, which they
name the Arlakoo or Hell-faced one, and they never
invoke it save when they desire the death of a
criminal, or some very aged, useless member of the
tribe. They then prepare a mixture of herbs and
berries, which they first of all dry, and, at the
psychical hour of two in the morning, put in an iron
pot and take into the presence of their intended
victim. Then, having set fire to the preparation,
which, though rather difficult to ignite, burns slowly
and surely when once aflame, they close all the
openings of the hut or room and beat a precipitate
retreat. A few minutes later the spirit they have
invoked appears, and, simultaneous with its materialisation,
the mixture burns a bright green and emits
a peculiarly offensive gas. The result is invariably
death: the shock produced by the harrowing
appearance of the apparition, coupled with the
poisonous nature of the fumes, is more than the
human mechanism can stand. Of course all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
would be mere moonshine to anyone who is uninitiated
in Eastern ways and doesn&rsquo;t believe in
ghosts. The Bournemouth doctors would pooh-pooh
it altogether. There is no other gas that I
know of that produces the effects you have described.
If there is another case, let me know, as
I should much like to see the victim.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>A ghost! A ghost employed for the purpose
of murdering someone! Even to me, confirmed
believer in the Unknown as I am, the idea seemed
wildly improbable and fantastic. And yet, what
else could have produced that look of horror in the
faces? What else could have killed them?</p>

<p>That evening, Sir Eldred and I sat in the smoke-room
after dinner and chatted away as usual. We
had our coffee brought to us at nine o&rsquo;clock, and
at ten-thirty we retired to bed. Sir Eldred had
appeared fidgety and nervous all the evening, and,
as we were ascending the stairs, he asked me if I
would mind sitting up with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel I shan&rsquo;t sleep to-night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as
I&rsquo;ve got one of my restless moods on. If it
won&rsquo;t be tiring you too much, will you come and
sit with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said I would with pleasure, but I did not join
him at once, as I wanted the servants to think we
had gone to our respective rooms and to bed as
usual. I also wanted whatever there might be
in the wind to mature.</p>

<p>On entering my room, I opened the window with
as little noise as possible, and was on the verge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
lowering myself into the garden when I espied
someone among the trees. I was going to draw
back, when the figure signalled, and I at once
knew it was Vane.</p>

<p>Another minute and I had found him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
here,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;be on the qui vive, and if
you want help call. See, I&rsquo;m armed.&rdquo; And he
pointed significantly to his breast pocket. He was
going to say something else when we heard steps&mdash;soft,
surreptitious steps that hardly sounded human&mdash;coming
in our direction. I immediately withdrew
to the house and hastened to Sir Eldred. At my
suggestion we both sat by the window, which I
noticed was shut&mdash;Sir Eldred, I knew, was very
susceptible to the cold&mdash;and I arranged the curtains
so that we could not be seen from the outside.
Sir Eldred occupied a sofa and I an easy chair.
For some time we talked in low voices, and then Sir
Eldred grew more and more drowsy till he finally
fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was one of the most exquisite nights I had ever
seen&mdash;the moon, so full and silvery, and everywhere
so calm, so gentle, and so still. Not a breath of
air, not a leaf stirring, not a sound to be heard;
nothing save the occasional burr of a great black
bat as it hurled itself past the window and went
wheeling and skimming in and out the tall, slender
pines. I sat still, my eyes wandering alternately
from the window to Sir Eldred. Whence would
come the danger my instinct told me threatened
him? How calmly he slept! How marked and
handsome were his boyish features!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly from afar off a distant church clock
began to strike two, each chime falling with an
extraordinary distinctness on the preternatural
hush.</p>

<p>Hardly had the last reverberating echoes ceased
before there was a loud click from somewhere near
the fireplace, and the next moment came a faint
smell of burning. Then I confess&mdash;remembering
all Craddock had told me&mdash;I was afraid. Everything
in the room&mdash;the big, open fireplace, the
dark, gleaming wardrobe, the quaintly carved
chairs, the rich but fantastically patterned curtains,
the sofa, and even Sir Eldred himself&mdash;I hardly
dared look at him&mdash;seemed impregnated with a
strange and startling uncanniness. The green light!
Was this the prelude to it? Was the terrible
Bornean phantasm getting ready to manifest itself?</p>

<p>I struggled hard, and, at last, overcoming the
feeling of utter helplessness that had begun to steal
over me, rushed to the windows. Frantically throwing
them open, I was preparing to do the same
to the door, when a low, ominous wail, sounding
at first from very far away, and then all of a sudden
from quite close at hand, brought me to a standstill,
and the whole room suddenly became illuminated
with a glow, of a shade and intensity of green I have
never seen before. Again there came an awful
struggle. I felt eyes glaring at me, eyes that belonged
to something of infinite hideousness and hate, to
something that was concentrating its very hardest
to make&mdash;to force&mdash;me to look; and it was only
by an effort that smothered my chest and forehead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in beads of cold sweat I desisted. Groping my
way across the room, with my eyes tightly closed,
I eventually reached the sofa. Thank God! Sir
Eldred was still asleep. Tired with a day&rsquo;s hard
exercise, he had fallen into the soundest of
slumbers. Putting one hand over his eyes, and
seizing him by the shoulder with the other, I
speedily roused him. &ldquo;Quick, quick!&rdquo; I shouted.
&ldquo;For the love of God get up quick! Keep your
mouth tightly shut and follow me.&rdquo; Pushing and
dragging him along, I made for the direction of the
door. The poison fumes now began to take effect;
my temples throbbed, my brain was on fire, a tight,
agonising feeling of suffocation gripped my chest
and throat, and, as I staggered with Sir Eldred
across the threshold on to the landing beyond, a
sea of blackness suddenly enveloped me, and I
knew no more.</p>

<p class="dots">.<span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span></p>

<p>On coming to, I found myself lying on the floor
of the corridor with Vane bending over me. &ldquo;I
was just in time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I saw you at the
window, saw you suddenly throw up your arms
and stagger away from it, and, guessing what was
happening, I ran to the house and, climbing up
the rope you had left hanging out of your window,
I managed to reach you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Eldred?&rdquo; I panted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Vane replied. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t
really so far gone as you. A few minutes more,
though, and you would both have been dead.
Now keep cool and don&rsquo;t say anything about it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
As soon as the air has cleared&mdash;quite cleared mind&mdash;go
to bed, and come down in the morning as if
nothing had happened. Fortunately you made no
noise, and I feel sure no one saw me enter the house.
If you will let me take the lead in this affair, I think
we may ferret the whole thing out. But we must
go carefully. You don&rsquo;t mind my playing the part
of instructor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind how despotic
you are so long as we get to the bottom of this
mystery. Fire ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; Vane said. &ldquo;Get up now and
hurry off to bed. And remember&mdash;both of you&mdash;not
a word to anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vaulting on to the window-sill as he spoke, he
caught hold of the rope and was speedily lost to
view.</p>

<p>When we came down in the morning we were
very careful to make no allusion to the night&rsquo;s
happening before the servants, but strove to appear
quite normal and unconcerned.</p>

<p>I watched Parry&rsquo;s face when he first encountered
us, but it was quite immobile. &ldquo;He is either
quite innocent,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;or a very old hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we were alone, Sir Eldred was very anxious
to hear what I thought. &ldquo;Have you been able to
form any theory,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;because I haven&rsquo;t.
I don&rsquo;t see how any of the servants could have
let that infernal stuff loose in the room last night.
I can swear there was no one there but ourselves.
And for the life of me I can&rsquo;t see any motive. If
any living person is responsible for it, he must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
a lunatic, for no one here has anything to gain by my
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite sure you have no near relatives?&rdquo;
I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;To the best of my
knowledge I am the very last of the Hampshire
Mansfields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our conversation was abruptly ended by the
entrance of a maid with a sealed note. It was
from Vane.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock to-night,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;get
Sir Eldred to tell the Parrys they must sit up
with him and you in his bedroom. See that
he doesn&rsquo;t let them off, as they are sure to
make excuses. Also get Craddock to come down
by an early afternoon train, and tell him to call
round and see me immediately he arrives. Leave
the rest to me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>This note needing no reply, I hastened off at once
to the General Post Office and telegraphed to Craddock.
Fortunately he was at home, and wired
that he would leave Waterloo by the two o&rsquo;clock
train. The remainder of the day passed very
slowly. At ten o&rsquo;clock that night someone whistled
from the pines, and I knew at once that it was Vane.
Craddock was with him. I conducted them both
into Sir Eldred&rsquo;s room, where they were closeted
together for some time, neither Sir Eldred nor I
being allowed to enter. At last eleven o&rsquo;clock
arrived, and Sir Eldred went to fetch the Parrys.
Both strongly demurred. Parry declared he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
unwell, and Mrs. Parry said she had never heard
of such a thing; but Sir Eldred insisted, and they
were obliged at last to follow him upstairs. Vane
and Craddock had hidden themselves so that the
Parrys only saw me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want us to do?&rdquo; Parry asked
nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merely to sit up with us and watch,&rdquo; Sir Eldred
said. &ldquo;Mr. Anderson&rdquo; (my alias) &ldquo;and I have a
presentiment that something may happen to-night
and we don&rsquo;t relish the idea of facing it alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d really rather not, sir,&rdquo; Parry faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Sir Eldred said sternly.
&ldquo;It is my wish. Come, if you talk like that, I
shall begin to think you are both afraid. We will
arrange ourselves round the fireplace. I&rsquo;ve an
idea that whatever comes will come down the
chimney. You sit there, Parry, next to Mr. Anderson.
Mrs. Parry shall sit by me.&rdquo; And without
further to do he pushed them both into their seats.
I could see they were very much agitated, but they
both lapsed into silence, and for some considerable
time no one in the room spoke. My thoughts, as
I presumed did Sir Eldred&rsquo;s, chiefly centred round
the question as to what was the great surprise
Vane had in store for us. What had he discovered?
What had he been so carefully plotting
with Craddock?</p>

<p>On flew the minutes, and at last Sir Eldred struck
a match; for the moon was temporarily hidden
by big, black, scouring clouds. &ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s close on two. The hour fatal to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
family. If anything is going to happen to-night
it should take place almost immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I was you, sir,&rdquo; Mrs. Parry burst out, &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t sit up any longer. I feel sure nothing
will happen to-night, and if it does, our being here
can do no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; Parry echoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must wait a little longer,&rdquo; Sir Eldred said.
&ldquo;See, it&rsquo;s almost on the stroke!&rdquo; As he spoke,
the moon shone out again in all her brilliant lustre,
and every object in the room became clearly visible.
Every eye was fixed on the clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; Mrs. Parry cried, springing to her
feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, Sir Eldred, if you give me
notice to leave. I&rsquo;ve had enough of this nonsense.&rdquo;
She was about to add more, when there was a sudden
click, exactly similar to the click we had heard the
preceding night, the dome-shaped top of the clock
flew open, and the smell of something burning,
but a far sweeter and more subtle odour than that
of the night before, filled the room. In an instant
the whole place was in an uproar. Mrs. Parry
shrieked for help, and declared she was being
choked, whilst Parry, falling on his knees, clutched
hold of Sir Eldred and implored his forgiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m about to die, sir,&rdquo; he whined, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
confess all. It&rsquo;s that cousin of yours, George, who
you never heard tell of. He&rsquo;s married to my
daughter Effie, and he wanted to come into your
property. He put us up to it; we only acted at
his bidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; a voice called out, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
behind the window-curtain stepped Vane, closely
followed by Craddock. &ldquo;You see, you can&rsquo;t help
lying, Parry, even when death stares you in
the face. Open the window a little wider, Mr.
Craddock, so that all this smoke, which is quite
harmless, by the way, can get out, and I&rsquo;ll
explain everything. The two people who have
been in the habit of prowling about your premises
at night, Sir Eldred, are Effie, the daughter of
these miscreants here, and George Mansfield, the
son of your Uncle Richard, whom Parry, truthful
for once in his life, said you had never heard of.
Your father never mentioned his nephew to you
because he was a half-caste, Richard Mansfield, to
your father&rsquo;s undying disgust, having married a
native of Borneo. George was brought up in
Borneo, and only came to England for the first time
three years ago, shortly after his father&rsquo;s death.
He had heard all about the family quarrel, and,
arriving in this country with none too friendly
feelings towards your parents, sought an interview
with Sir Thomas, who, if George&rsquo;s version of it is
correct, was very curt, forbidding him ever again
to enter the house. Filled with intense hatred
against you all, George Mansfield went to London,
and about that time met Effie Parry, who was then
on &lsquo;the halls,&rsquo; acting under the name of Grahame.
In due course of time he married her, and it was she
who first suggested to him the idea of contriving
by some means or other to come into the family
estate. It is easy enough to gather what lay at
the back of her brain when she used the euphemism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
&lsquo;some means or other.&rsquo; Life in the south-eastern
states of Borneo, from which George Mansfield hails,
is held of small account; he at once tumbled to the
suggestion, and decided to summon to his assistance
a spirit they worship out there called Arlakoo.
In order to invoke the Arlakoo it was essential
that certain herbs should be procured, and this
necessitated time and expense. Eventually, however,
through the agency of friends&mdash;Borneans&mdash;they
were obtained. Then came the question of
introducing them into the right quarters. Effie&rsquo;s
parents both inherit criminal tendencies: Parry&rsquo;s
Uncle James was a notorious forger, and Mrs.
Parry&rsquo;s grandmother was hanged for baby-farming.
You needn&rsquo;t look so indignant, you two, for I&rsquo;ve
been to the C.I.D.&mdash;you know what the C.I.D. is&mdash;for
my information. Well, the Parrys were taken
into confidence, and Sir Thomas, being in need of
both a butler and housekeeper just then, the two
applied for the posts and got them. The rest was
comparatively easy. George is an engineer by
profession and has a good inventive faculty. Coming
to this house when the family were all away, he
espied the clock you see on the mantelshelf, in the
room your mother and father slept in, and, on
examining the dome, discovered that it opened,
and that there was a Cupid inside it which, when
in proper working order, bounced out whenever
the hour struck. It appears to have been in your
family a good many years, Sir Eldred, for George
Mansfield had previously come across a reference
to it in one of his father&rsquo;s diaries, and his fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
brain now conceived the idea of using it in the
process of carrying his scheme into effect. In the
place of the Cupid he resolved to insert a miniature
brazier containing the herbs and supplied with an
electric fuse, the mechanism of which could be so
contrived that whenever the clock should strike two,
and two only, the dome would fly open, the brazier
spring up, and the herbal preparation be ignited.
He was only too well aware of the hereditary
tendency of the Mansfield family to heart disease,
and calculated that the shock of seeing so awful an
apparition as the Arlakoo (which he firmly believed
he could call up), together with the poisonous
fumes that accompanied it&mdash;provided the door and
windows were shut, which could be accomplished
with the assistance of the Parrys&mdash;would encompass
the deaths he desired. He chose, for his first
victim, your mother. The day you and your
father went to London to meet your brother, Parry
smuggled George Mansfield into the house, and the
latter, seizing an opportunity when your mother
was out, fitted up the clock with the brazier containing
the herbal preparation and the fuse. As
you know, his diabolical scheme succeeded only too
well, not only your mother, but your father and
brother falling victims to it. This morning Mrs.
Parry paid a visit to her son-in-law, and I overheard
their conversation. Great surprise was expressed
at the failure of the clock yesterday, and it was
decided to try it again to-night. This is the result.
The vapour you saw come out of the clock just now
was a quite harmless gas which Mr. Craddock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
substituted for the original preparation George
Mansfield had put there. We caught George nicely
in the garden shortly after nine. We threatened
to treat him in a thoroughly Bornean fashion&rdquo;&mdash;and
Vane produced his revolver&mdash;&ldquo;and he then
confessed everything. He is now in the safe
custody of the C.I.D. men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come to suspect the clock, Vane?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget the hole in the wall,&rdquo; he said, laughing.
&ldquo;I overheard continual allusion to the clock, and
&lsquo;filling and charging&rsquo; it again, and as I knew it
was not customary to fill and charge clocks, I at
once smelt a rat. My suspicions were confirmed
when I came to your rescue last night and saw
tiny spirals of the green vapour still emanating
from the dome-shaped top. I consulted with Mr.
Craddock, and with his assistance I was able to
carry out this little plot which, I think, we will
all agree has succeeded almost beyond expectation.
Any more questions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for the present, Mr. Vane,&rdquo; Sir Eldred
said. &ldquo;I must, first of all, express my deep sense
of gratitude to you for the clever way in which you
have managed to frustrate the plot to take my life.
You have captured one villain; it now remains to
deal with these scoundrels here. I wish to goodness
my cousin had not been involved in it. I suppose,
by the way, there is no doubt that this George
Mansfield is my cousin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear none whatever,&rdquo; Vane said. &ldquo;I called
at his rooms when I knew he was out, and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
documents there which fully established his identity.
I&rsquo;m afraid you must prosecute him with the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sir Eldred, fortunately, was spared that
degradation; for hardly had Vane finished speaking
when one of the C.I.D. men arrived at the house
and informed us that George Mansfield was no more.
He had evaded justice by swallowing a poisonous
lozenge which he had secreted in his handkerchief.</p>

<p>The Parrys were let go; the law does not acknowledge
the superphysical, and Sir Eldred recognised
the futility of prosecuting them. They eventually
went to Canada and were heard of no more. The
Caspar Beeches, however, had got a sinister name;
no tradespeople would venture within its grounds
after dusk, and no servants would stay there.
Sir Eldred himself lived in a constant state of fear,
and confided in me that he frequently heard strange
noises&mdash;doors opening and shutting of their own
accord, and soft, inexplicable footsteps. Eventually
the house was shut up, and, although it has since
been periodically occupied, no one ever cares to
remain in it for long.</p>

<p>When once invoked, it seems that spirits, especially
evil ones, have an unpleasant habit of clinging
to a person or place, and, in spite of what some
people assert, can seldom, if ever, be laid.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a><span class="g">CHAPTER XII</span><br />
<br />
THE STEPPING-STONES</h2>



<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> Coalbrookdale and the Wrekin, in a
charmingly wooded valley, flows a stream crossed
by seven stepping-stones, and on one bank of the
stream are the ruins of what was once a farmhouse.
People shun the spot at night, and tell strange tales
of the uncanny things that are seen there.</p>

<p>The following narrative may very possibly afford
an explanation of the alleged hauntings.</p>

<p>About noon one stifling hot day in August,
rather more than thirty years ago, Robert Redblake
Casson, senior partner of the firm of Casson, Hunter
&amp; Co., ivory merchants, of Old Queen Street,
London, walked into the Fox and Greyhound
Inn, Coalbrookdale, and ordered luncheon. While
he was eating&mdash;there was no one else in the dining-room
at the time&mdash;his eyes wandered to a large
oil-painting hanging on the wall facing him. It
represented a stream spanned by seven large
stepping-stones. In the background of the picture,
and leading to the bank of the stream, was a broad
and very white pathway, bordered on either side
by a thickly planted row of lofty pines. The
artist, Casson thought, had depicted this scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
with a more than ordinary touch of realism. The
trees were no mere paint-and-canvas duds, but
things of life&mdash;things that stood out prominently,
each with an individuality of its own. He could
almost see them move, see the rustling of their
foliage and hear the creaking of their gently swaying
bodies. Their shadows, too, were no empty, meaningless
daubs, such as one too often sees in pictures,
but counterparts, living, breathing counterparts,
that, while conveying a sense of the physical,
conveyed also a suggestion of the inexplicable. As
to the water in the stream which rippled and babbled
as it flowed, Casson could feel the speed and gauge
the shallowness of it everywhere, saving round the
centre stepping-stone, where it was green, and
seemed to possess the stillness that great depths
alone can generate. There was sunlight everywhere
on the surface of the water, and here and
there it shone and sparkled with all the brilliant
lustre of the goldfishes&rsquo; scales; but despite this
animation, a sense of utter loneliness, a feeling of
intense isolation, seemed to permeate the whole
thing, and Casson, as he gazed, felt both chilled
and depressed.</p>

<p>He was still looking at the picture, and wondering
what there could be in it to cause such a sensation
of chilliness, when something made him glance at
the stepping-stones, and, to his utter amazement, he
saw the centre one suddenly begin to oscillate.</p>

<p>Thinking it must be some kind of optical illusion,
Casson rubbed his eyes and looked again, but the
stone was still shaking, and he fancied he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
discern the shadowy and indistinct outline of something
or someone standing on it, swaying violently
to and fro.</p>

<p>The phenomenon lasted some seconds, and then
very abruptly ceased.</p>

<p>Casson got up from the table and walked right
up to the picture. He examined it closely, and,
oddly enough, although he was standing on the
floor a foot or so away from the canvas, he yet felt
he was absorbed by it, and part and parcel of the
surroundings it depicted. The stone was quite
motionless now, but despite this fact, the fact that
it now lay firmly embedded in its cup-like basin,
Casson was acutely conscious that it had moved.
Moreover, its present stillness was of the most
impressive nature; it was, as it were, the stillness
that only comes after great emotion. Casson
looked for the name of the artist, and at last, in
one corner of the canvas, painted in sepia to tone
with the general colouring, he found the signature.
It was &ldquo;Ralph L. Wotherall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he ejaculated; &ldquo;this must be
my old friend. There cannot be two Ralph L.
Wotheralls. Besides, I remember he used to be
fond of painting, and, judging from this specimen,
he must have taken to it professionally. How I
should like to meet him again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His memory ran back a clear score of years.
He and Wotherall had been the staunchest of
friends; they had shared a study in Dempster&rsquo;s
House at Harley. Wotherall was quite the best
boy in the school in drawing; indeed, it was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the only subject he was good in; and he had often
remarked to Casson that whatever his father, who
was a big timber merchant, might desire to the
contrary, he meant to go to the Slade School in
London and be an artist. He decorated the walls
of the study with sketches and caricatures of the
boys and masters&mdash;Casson even now laughed as
he thought of some of them&mdash;and during his last
term at the old place he had executed an oil-painting.
If Casson remembered correctly, it depicted a river
(Wotherall had always evinced a very strong
fascination for water scenery), and was hung in a
very conspicuous place over the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Wotherall had not been popular at Harley. He
was no good at games, and did not take the trouble
to conceal his dislike of them. Besides, he had no
respect for conventions; he did not have a fag, and
inveighed hotly against those who did; he thought
nothing of the &ldquo;caps&rdquo; and other big-wigs, and was
invariably in trouble, either with a master, a House
Sixth, or somebody of an equally recognised importance.
Still, for all that, he had been a most
excellent chum, and he, Casson, had repeatedly
felt a longing to see him again, if only to chat about
the many escapades they had had together. What
had become of him, he wondered? Strange that
that stone in the picture should have attracted his
attention&mdash;should have led him to look for the
name of the artist, and to discover in it his old
friend! Of course the rocking of the stone was a
hallucination. Probably his sight had played him
a trick or his brain had suddenly become giddy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
How could a stone in a picture&mdash;a thing of mere
paint and canvas&mdash;suddenly start rocking? The
thing was too fantastic for words, and he walked
back to his seat, laughing. Ringing the bell, he
asked to see the landlord, and when the latter
appeared, he inquired of him how he had come by
the picture, and if he knew the artist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bought that picture, sir,&rdquo; the landlord replied,
&ldquo;of a woman of the name of Griffiths. I happened
to be passing her house&mdash;Stepping-Stone Farm,
they call it&mdash;one day, when she was having a sale
of some of her live stock, together with a few odds
and ends in the way of surplus furniture, books,
pictures, etc. I am very fond of a good landscape,
sir, particularly with a bit of water in it, and
there was something about this one that specially
appealed to me. That, sir, is the stream that
flows outside the old woman&rsquo;s house, and it was
painted, so she informed me, by an artist who
used to lodge with her, but had to leave in the end
because he was stony-broke, and hadn&rsquo;t the wherewithal
to go on paying the rent. A not uncommon
happening with artists, sir, so I have always been
given to understand. From what I gathered he
owed the old woman pounds, and the few things
he left behind him&mdash;knick-knacks and a couple of
pictures&mdash;I bought the lot&mdash;was all the compensation
she could ever get out of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know where he went, I suppose?&rdquo;
Casson said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the landlord replied, shaking his head.
&ldquo;Mrs. Griffiths did not volunteer that information,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and, as I was not particularly interested in the
fellow, I didn&rsquo;t ask her. She doesn&rsquo;t live very
far from here, however, and if you would like to
see her, sir, you could hire a trap and drive over,
or even walk&mdash;though, maybe, you&rsquo;d find walking
a bit too tiring this weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Casson thanked the landlord, and, feeling particularly
fit and well, decided to set off at once
on foot to Stepping-Stone Farm. He had little
difficulty in finding the way, thanks to the prodigality
of the local authorities in their distribution
of signposts, and the sun had hardly begun to set,
when a sudden swerve of the road showed him
an avenue of trees that he instantly identified as
that depicted in Wotherall&rsquo;s picture. Everywhere
he encountered the same atmosphere of intense
loneliness and isolation, not untinged with a
melancholy, that had the most depressing effect,
and filled his mind with a hundred and one dismal
reflections.</p>

<p>Advancing over the white soil he soon heard the
rushing of water, and saw, straight ahead of him
and apparently barring his progress, a broad stream,
that seemed unusually full of water for the time
of year. As he drew near he perceived the stream
was spanned by seven stepping-stones, and, drawing
nearer still, he saw that, just as in Wotherall&rsquo;s
picture, the water on either side the middle and
largest of the stones formed two big pools, one
of which was singularly green and suggestive of
very great depth.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the stream, almost on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
its very bank, a farmyard encircled a long, low
building, the walls of which were barely visible
beneath a profusion of pink and white roses, clematis
and honeysuckle. Casson thought he had never
seen anything quite so enchanting, and, being a
man who invariably acted upon impulse, decided
to ask Mrs. Griffiths, whose house it undoubtedly
was, to put him up for the night. To do that,
however, he would of course have to cross the
stream. Now Casson had often crossed deep
rivers in Norway by stepping-stones, and in crossing
these rivers he had twice seen a man slip and,
with one agonising shriek of despair, plunge headlong
into the seething foam, his body, bruised and
battered and hardly recognisable, being found
many days later, calmly floating in some obscure
nook maybe a mile or so away; and compared
with these Scandinavian rivers the stream that
now faced him was but a brooklet. All the same,
he had never experienced such an intense fear
and feeling of insecurity as now, when, stepping
lightly over the first three stones, he landed on the
centre one and gazed into the green, silent depths
of the largest and deepest of the two pools that lay
on either side of it. There was something curiously
unnatural about this pool; he had never seen such
a pronounced green in fresh water before, and its
depth was in such marked contrast to the shallow,
babbling water all around it. As he peered into
it, a dark shadow seemed to well up to its
surface, but he could trace no likeness in it to
himself, and the trees were too far off for it to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
produced by any one of them. He was asking
himself how it could have come there, when his
eyes wandered to the stone on which he was
standing.</p>

<p>What an odd shape it was, nearly round and
slightly convex, like the back of a turtle or some
other queer amphibious creature, and it moved; he
was positive of that, but it did not move with the
rocking, vibrating movement he had witnessed in
the picture; it moved with a furtive, sidelong,
crawling action, as if it were alive. The sensation
was unendurable. He turned to go, and, as he
leaped through the air to the fourth stone, something
whose attitude towards him he could not exactly
define seemed to rise out of the green pool with
astonishing celerity and leap with him. Arriving
on the seventh and last stone, he was conscious of a
strong restraining influence, an enigmatical something
that seemed to be trying to pull him back, and
it was only by exerting every atom of his will power
that he succeeded in forcing himself forward.
However, the moment his feet touched the bank
and he was quite clear of the water, he was himself
again. He turned and looked at the stone. It
was absolutely motionless, while a stray sunbeam,
gilding the surface of the silent pool, made it appear
quite ridiculously cheerful. Vexed with himself for
being such a fool, Casson now crossed the farmyard
and, going up to the house, knocked at the
door. It was opened by a middle-aged woman,
who might once have been the village belle, but
who was now thin and worn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, running her eyes carefully over
Casson&rsquo;s face and clothes. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you Mrs. Griffiths?&rdquo; Casson ejaculated.
&ldquo;I am a friend of Mr. Wotherall. I understand he
once boarded with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the woman replied. &ldquo;He lived
with me more than six months, and left two years
ago last May. He didn&rsquo;t owe you anything, did
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Casson replied quickly; &ldquo;far from it.
He and I were old schoolfellows. I saw a picture
of his at the place I lunched at to-day, and, hearing
he had been in the neighbourhood, I thought I
would like to find out his present whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve come to inquire of me, I&rsquo;m afraid
you&rsquo;ll be disappointed,&rdquo; Mrs. Griffiths responded,
&ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve neither seen him nor heard from him since
he went away, and he would not leave any address
for letters to be forwarded, as he said he had written
to all his friends to tell them not to write here
any more. A good many bills, but nothing else,
came for him after he left, and those I have returned
to the Dead Letter Office. He was very
hard up, poor gentleman, and it&rsquo;s my opinion he
didn&rsquo;t want his creditors to know what had become
of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he must have lost money then,&rdquo;
Casson murmured, &ldquo;for I always understood that
his people were very comfortably fixed, and that he
was an only child. Poor old Wotherall, I should
so like to have met him again! Do you still let
rooms?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Mrs. Griffiths replied; &ldquo;a top bedroom
and parlour. The same two as Mr. Wotherall
had. The last people that occupied them, a commercial
traveller and his wife from Leeds, only left
last week. Would you like to see them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Casson acquiesced, and, liking the look of the
rooms immensely, took them for a fortnight, which
was all that remained of his seven weeks&rsquo; holidays.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a charming spot,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;and I can
easily amuse myself mooching about the fields or
lying by the stream reading. Rest and quiet,
and a plain, wholesome diet, such as one always
gets at a farm, are just the very things I need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had a gorgeous tea that evening&mdash;strawberries,
freshly gathered from the garden, cream,
delicious butter and bread, none of that mysterious
substitute that is palmed off on one nowadays in
most of the London hotels and restaurants, but real
home-made bread, which tasted far nicer than anything
he had ever eaten in Bond Street or Piccadilly&mdash;and
he enjoyed the meal so much, in fact, that he
felt in a particularly amiable frame of mind, and
thoroughly well satisfied with the world in general.</p>

<p>Presently he got up, intending to go out. He
crossed the stone-flagged hall, and, passing the
kitchen, the door of which was slightly open, he
perceived Mrs. Griffiths busily engaged at a pastry-board
rolling away as if for dear life. Wishing to
be sociable, he called out, and as soon as she invited
him in, opened up a conversation with her, inquiring
how many cows she kept, how much land she
rented, and had she a good crop of fruit. Whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
she was answering these questions, expatiating to no
small degree on the trials and drawbacks of having
to run a farm without a husband to look after it
(she had, she remarked, with much emphasis and
a dangerous approach to tears, been married twice,
her first husband, &ldquo;the best man as ever breathed,&rdquo;
dying of consumption, and her second, a drunkard
and a bad lot in every way, deserting her and going
off to America, so she had always believed, with
some other woman); whilst, I say, she was engaged
telling him all this, he suddenly found himself gazing
at an object hanging on the wall near the grandfather
clock. It was a striped chocolate, white,
and blue scarf, with the letters H.C. in white standing
out in bold relief. He recognised the colours
at once; they were the colours of Dempster&rsquo;s House
at Harley. Evidently Wotherall had left the
scarf behind as part of the personal effects that he
had had to hand over to Mrs. Griffiths, in order to
appease her indignation at his failure to produce
the rent. Poor beggar, he must indeed have been
hard pushed to part with so sacred a memento of
his early life. Casson, like every other Harleyan,
had the greatest reverence and affection for everything
associated with the old School, the mere
thought of which even now sent a thrill of genuine
emotion through him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you have got a souvenir of my friend over
there,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the scarf. &ldquo;I suppose
he made you a present of it when he left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Mrs. Griffiths demanded,
abruptly breaking off from her pastry-making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
&ldquo;A souvenir of your friend? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that scarf hanging on the wall there,&rdquo;
Casson cried, again indicating with his hand its
whereabouts. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my old School, or rather House,
scarf. But what makes it blow about so? There
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;House! scarf! colours!&rdquo; Mrs. Griffiths ejaculated.
&ldquo;I never heard tell of such things. You
must be crazy. There&rsquo;s nothing on the wall saving
that almanac that was given me by the grocer over
in Coalbrookdale for a Christmas present. Have
you never seen an almanac before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not made of wool and behaving like that,&rdquo;
Casson remarked. Then, going a few steps nearer,
he gave vent to a loud exclamation of surprise.
There was no scarf there at all, not the vestige of
one, only a picture almanac representing an intensely
silly-looking girl holding a lawn-tennis
racket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My liver must be very wrong and I must be
more than ordinarily bilious,&rdquo; Casson said. &ldquo;I
could have sworn it was a scarf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re run down; been working too hard,
Mr. Casson,&rdquo; Mrs. Griffiths observed. &ldquo;What you
want is a rest. Go to bed early, and don&rsquo;t try your
eyes over books and letter-writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Casson thanked her for her advice and, turning on
his heels, left the kitchen. For one brief second he
paused to look back. Mrs. Griffiths was staring
after him, and in the depths of her large china-blue
eyes, the pupils of which seemed to have grown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
an unusual size, he read an expression of curiosity
intermingled with fear.</p>

<p>The next few hours Casson spent lying on the grassy
bank of the stream. There was something wonderfully
soothing in the constant rustling of the leaves
of the big trees in the avenue, and the eternal babble,
babble, babble of the water. At times he construed
the sounds into real sighings and whisperings, and
fancied he could hear his name called, &ldquo;Casson!
Casson! Casson!&rdquo; very softly and plaintively,
but occasionally with such reality that he started,
and had to reassure himself earnestly that it was
all imagination. Then the shadows on the white
soil of the avenue riveted his attention. That
they were only the shadows of the trees he had no
doubt, and yet he queried every now and then if
he had ever before seen shadows flit about and contort
themselves in quite such an incomprehensible
manner. The emptiness of the avenue, too, seemed
so emphasised. Why was it so deserted? Why
weren&rsquo;t there people about&mdash;living beings among
those dark swaying trees and bushes like there were
in the London parks? He did not know if he
altogether liked the avenue now, when twilight was
coming on. His eyes had tricked him in the
kitchen; might they not trick him again out here,
and in a rather more alarming manner? He would
not look at the avenue again, not till it was broad
daylight; he would turn his attention to something
else. And then, of course, his eyes rested on the
stepping-stones. One, two, three, four, he counted.
There was that confounded queer-shaped middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
stone again, and that pool! How black and
sinister they both looked in the semi-darkness! He
would sound the pool in the morning and see if
it was really as deep as he fancied. He turned
away his eyes and tried to keep his attention concentrated
on something else, but it was never any
good, and in the end he invariably caught himself
gazing at the stones, and particularly at the middle
one. At last, tearing himself away with an effort,
he went indoors and had supper, and at ten o&rsquo;clock
by his watch wended his way upstairs to bed. Just
outside his door he suddenly pulled himself up
sharply. Another step, and he felt he would have
collided with something or somebody, and yet,
when he looked there was nothing&mdash;nothing save
space. More convinced than ever now that there
was something wrong either with the place or
himself, Casson entered his room and proceeded to
get into bed. The exertions of the day had made
him tired, and he was soon asleep. He supposed he
slept for about three hours, for he awoke with a
start to hear the kitchen clock hurriedly strike two.
His heart was beating furiously, and he had the
most uncomfortable feeling that there was someone
besides himself in the room. He fought against
this feeling for some time, until, at last, unable to
endure it any longer, he got out of bed, lit the candle,
and searched the room thoroughly. The door was
locked on the inside&mdash;he remembered locking it&mdash;and
he was quite alone. &ldquo;It must be nerves,&rdquo;
he said, getting back into bed and blowing out
the light. &ldquo;A strong tonic is what I want. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
write to Dr. Joyce for one to-morrow. But I&rsquo;ve
never been afflicted with nerves before! And in
all consciousness I live simply enough; so I don&rsquo;t
know why I should suddenly develop biliousness.&rdquo;
Then seized with a sudden desire to blow his nose,
and recollecting that his handkerchief was on the
chair by the bedside, he was putting out his hand
to grope for it, when he felt it quietly thrust into
his palm.</p>

<p>After that he pulled the bedclothes tightly over
his head and kept them there till the morning.
With the sunlight all doubts and uneasiness
vanished, and Casson got out of bed fully convinced
that all his experiences of the previous night were
due to mere nervousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Londoner,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;and, not being
used to the quiet and loneliness of these out-of-the-way
places, I got the wind up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Breakfast made him even more confident, and
he went out into the yard in the cheeriest mood
possible. After amusing himself watching the
poultry, pigs, and other animals, he wandered
through a wicket-gate into a field, and then through
another field down to the stream. While he was
threading his way back to the farm, through a mass
of gorse and other undergrowth, he came upon a
boy bending over a fishing-rod, busily intent on
putting something red and raw&mdash;like uncooked meat&mdash;on
a hook. &ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s that horrid-looking
stuff,&rdquo; Casson said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never catch fish with
bait like that. Why don&rsquo;t you use dough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cos I know they like this best,&rdquo; was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
answer, and the boy looked up at Casson and
grinned.</p>

<p>Casson was now so taken up with the boy&rsquo;s
appearance that he forgot all about the bait.
He had never seen such an unpleasant, queer,
malshapen face before. The cranium was disproportionately
large; the forehead and sides of
the head immediately above and behind the ears
were enormously developed; the chin was small
and retreating; the ears, which stood very pronouncedly
out from the head, were very big and
pointed; the mouth huge; the eyes big, dark,
and very heavily lidded; the skin yellow and unhealthy.
The face was unprepossessing enough in
repose, but when the lips opened and it smiled,
the likeness to some ghoulish, froggish, and wholly
monstrous kind of animal was increased a hundredfold,
and Casson started back in dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;and what
right have you to fish here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like that&mdash;I do,&rdquo; the boy grunted. &ldquo;Why,
I&rsquo;ve every right. I&rsquo;m Ephraim Owen Lloyd. My
mother, her you&rsquo;re staying with, was Mrs. Owen
Lloyd before she married again and took the name
of Griffiths. No right to fish here! You tell
my mother that and see what she says.&rdquo; And,
grinning wider than ever, he picked up the baited
hook and flung it far into the stream.</p>

<p>Not wishing to have any further conversation
with him, and feeling thoroughly disgusted and
repelled, Casson walked on towards the stones.
&ldquo;Fancy being under the same roof with a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
degenerate like that!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I
wish now I hadn&rsquo;t decided to stay so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slashing at the grass and other herbage with
his stick&mdash;a trick Casson always resorted to when
unsettled or annoyed&mdash;he reached the stones, and
was about to turn into the yard when he received
something of a surprise. A man in flannels, with
a chocolate, white, and blue striped blazer, passed
him by and, crossing the yard, vanished round
an angle of the house. Casson did not see his face,
but the back of his head, his figure, and walk at
once recalled Wotherall. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s not Ralph,&rdquo;
Casson exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat my hat! I wonder why
he&rsquo;s come back? It will give him a bit of a surprise
when he sees me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the front door he ran into Mrs. Griffiths,
who, with an apron full of French beans, was
making for the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo; Casson inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen who?&rdquo; Mrs. Griffiths rejoined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man in the blazer, of course,&rdquo; Casson replied.
&ldquo;Mr. Wotherall, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wotherall!&rdquo; Mrs. Griffiths exclaimed,
stopping short and staring hard at Casson. &ldquo;You
seem to have got Mr. Wotherall on the brain.
Mr. Wotherall is nowhere near here&mdash;leastways, if
he is, I&rsquo;ve seen no signs of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, there he is!&rdquo; Casson cried excitedly,
pointing at a window, through which he saw a
figure in the familiar Harleyan House blazer
saunter slowly by. &ldquo;That is Wotherall. He
hasn&rsquo;t altered in the least. See, he&rsquo;s looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
straight in here&mdash;at me! I&rsquo;ll go and speak to
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran to the door and threw it open. To his
astonishment, there was no one there but young
Ephraim Lloyd, who met his puzzled expression
with an impudent leer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Wotherall?&rdquo; Casson cried.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy&rsquo;s countenance instantly underwent a
change. &ldquo;Mr. Wotherall!&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;What
do you know of Mr. Wotherall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know of him?&rdquo; Casson retorted angrily.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business. He was here a few seconds
ago, and now I can see no trace of him. Where
is he, I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Griffiths had deposited the
beans on the kitchen table and joined the two at
the door. &ldquo;Take no notice of the gentleman,&rdquo;
she said to Ephraim, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s overwork. Been a-studying
too hard. I&rsquo;ve told him he must throw
aside his books and letter-writing while he is here,
and rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; Casson said &ldquo;that
neither of you saw a man in a blazer pass here just
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw!&rdquo; Ephraim drawled. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen no
one. There&rsquo;s no man in a blazer or in any other
kind of thing anywhere about here. There&rsquo;s no
man at all except yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; Mrs. Griffiths chipped in.
&ldquo;I told the gentleman so, only he won&rsquo;t believe
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have been dreaming, then,&rdquo; Casson
replied reluctantly; &ldquo;but, at all events, I am awake
now, and should like my dinner, Mrs. Griffiths, as
soon as you can get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That ended the incident. Casson retreated to his
parlour, and the other two, after mumbling for
awhile in the hall, retired together to the kitchen.
The rest of the day passed uneventfully, and, once
again, Casson found himself, candle in hand, wending
his way upstairs to bed.</p>

<p>Just outside his door the same thing happened
as on the previous night. He thought he saw
someone standing there, and pulled himself up
sharply to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>Once inside his room he locked the door, and
then looked everywhere to make sure no one was
hiding. That preliminary over, he stood for a
while by the window smoking, then undressed, and
got into bed. Leaning on his elbow, he was about
to blow out the candle, which was on the chair
by his side, when there was a big puff and it was
blown out for him. No thought of investigating
this time entered Casson&rsquo;s mind; he dived deep
under the bedclothes, and did not emerge till Mrs.
Griffiths, almost thumping his door down, announced
that his breakfast was on the table getting cold.
After breakfast he went for a ramble in the fields,
and as he had no desire to come in contact with
Ephraim, towards whom he had taken a most
violent dislike, he headed in a direction away from
the stream. He had not gone many yards, however,
when he heard a cat screaming as if in fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
pain. Thinking some dog had got hold of it and
was worrying it to death, and being very fond of
cats, Casson at once made for the sounds, and in
an open space, within a few yards of the stream,
came upon a spectacle that he felt he could never
forget, even if he lived a thousand years.</p>

<p>Tied down securely with cord to the top of a big
wooden box was a black and white cat. Ephraim
had hooked out one of its eyes, which was on the
ground near his fishing-line, and was now about
to hook out the other. The mystery of the bait
Casson had seen him using the day before was thus
explained.</p>

<p>With something like a howl of fury Casson
rushed at Ephraim, and, seizing him by the scruff
of his neck, thrashed him until his arms ached.
Then flinging him on the ground with the remark,
&ldquo;You little devil, I hope I&rsquo;ve killed you,&rdquo; he untied
the cat. Weak with pain and loss of blood, the
wretched animal had not the strength to move, and
Casson, lifting it tenderly up, carried it to the house.
Going straight into the kitchen, he showed it to
Mrs. Griffiths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is your son&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to show it to the police at once, and I only hope
he&rsquo;ll get a thorough good birching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Griffiths ceased what she was doing and
looked at Casson defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want to interfere with Ephraim
for?&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t done nothing to
you, has he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done nothing to me, perhaps,&rdquo; Casson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
retorted, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s done something to this cat.
You can see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s only a boy,&rdquo; Mrs. Griffiths responded;
&ldquo;and if he has ill-treated the cat, there&rsquo;s not much
harm done. I expect it&rsquo;s the same cat that has
been after the chickens. The cats about here are
a perfect pest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no excuse for hooking their eyes out,&rdquo;
Casson said hotly. &ldquo;I intend leaving at once.
Here&rsquo;s a week&rsquo;s rent,&rdquo; and, taking some money
from his pocket, he deposited it on the table.</p>

<p>At that moment there were sounds of steps on
the gravel outside, loud hullabalooings, and Ephraim
burst into the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman&rsquo;s been hitting me,&rdquo; he bellowed.
&ldquo;He struck me on the head and boxed my ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You struck him!&rdquo; Mrs. Griffiths screamed,
her cheeks white with fury. &ldquo;You dared to strike
him! I&rsquo;ll have the law on you, see if I don&rsquo;t.
There, there, Ephraim, cease crying, and you shall
have what is left of that custard pudding you liked
so much yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This bribe apparently taking effect, Mrs. Griffiths
gave her offspring a final cuddle, and then veered
round with the intention of renewing an attack
upon Casson. Before she could open her mouth
to speak, however, there was another howling on
the part of Ephraim, and Casson, under cover of it
hurried off to his bedroom to collect his things.
As he went upstairs, both the boy and his mother
showered abuses on him, and he thought he heard
Ephraim say something to the effect that he wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
they could serve him as they had served someone
else&mdash;the name of the someone else being drowned
in a loud hush from Mrs. Griffiths, who afterwards
began to speak very excitedly in Welsh.</p>

<p>On reaching his room Casson sought to revive
the cat. He gave it some brandy from his flask,
but the animal had been so badly mauled that all
his efforts were in vain, and in a very few minutes
it succumbed. He was thinking how he should
carry it to the police station, when he heard a
growl, and, looking round, saw a big black retriever
dog, with a bright steel collar, standing on its hind
legs, with its back towards him, gazing out of the
window. Wondering whose dog it was, and what it
was growling at, Casson went to the window, and,
looking out, saw Mrs. Griffiths and the boy, each
armed with a long pole, making off in the direction
of the stream. Once or twice they peeped round,
(whereupon Casson quickly hid himself behind the
curtain), and then, apparently satisfied that they
had not been seen, kept on following the course of
the stream till they arrived at the stepping-stones.
Crossing the first two, they stood on the third, and,
thrusting the tops of their poles under the middle
one, began to lever it up. Casson now thought it
high time to depart. He felt convinced that they
were setting some kind of trap for him, and that
the exact nature of it was only known to themselves.
Thanking his lucky stars that he had happened to
look out of the window in time to see their little
game, and determining to escape at once, avoiding
the stepping-stones at all costs, he was preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to leave the room, when he suddenly thought of
the dog. It was nowhere to be seen, and the door
and the window were both shut. Where could it
be? He looked under the bed, in the cupboard,
everywhere; it was useless&mdash;the dog had vanished!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sooner I am out of this house,&rdquo; he muttered,
as he ran downstairs and out at the kitchen
door, &ldquo;the better.&rdquo; And taking care, as he crossed
the yard, to keep well out of sight of the stepping-stones,
he ran in an opposite direction, without
stopping for at least a mile.</p>

<p>Eventually he crossed the stream by a bridge,
and found his way to a village, from whence he was
able to proceed by train to Coalbrookdale. Arriving
at the latter place, he went at once to the police,
and telling them first of all about the cat, went on
to narrate all that had happened to him at the
farm. The police were not altogether unsympathetic;
they could, however, so they said, do
nothing with regard to the cat without corroborative
evidence, and, as to the other matter, they were
afraid the law did not take cognizance of the superphysical,
or suspicion founded on anything so
immaterial as ghosts, although they themselves
would not like to go as far as to deny their existence
altogether. At length, being unable to prevail
upon the police to do anything, Casson, by offering
a handsome remuneration, persuaded two labourers
to accompany him back to the stream. Arriving
at the stepping-stones, they cautiously examined
the middle one, and found it to be so poised that
anyone standing on it would, by its unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
tilt, suddenly be precipitated into a deep hole
directly underneath it.</p>

<p>After considerable difficulty the stone was sufficiently
moved on one side to enable the workmen
to explore this hole, and at the bottom of it the
skeletons of two men and a dog were discovered.</p>

<p>There was nothing on the one skeleton that
could in any way help to identify it; but remnants
of clothes, ragged and rotten, still adhered to the
other, and from the name engraven on a card-case
in the pocket of the coat, which tallied with the
initials on the undergarments and a signet ring,
there was little doubt but that the remains were
those of Ralph Wotherall. [From subsequent inquiries
it was ascertained that the friends and
relatives of Ralph Wotherall had heard from him
immediately prior to the time he was supposed to
have left Stepping-Stone Farm, but had not heard
from him since, a fact to which they had attributed
little importance, as Wotherall, on more than one
occasion, had suddenly decided to go abroad, where
he had stayed for a couple of years or so without
letting anyone know where he was or what he was
doing. The story, they said, of his being so hard
up as to be unable to pay the rent could be
discredited by his solicitors, who would testify to
the fact that they had but recently invested a
large sum of money for him, from which he was
deriving a not inconsiderable income.] A steel
collar bearing the initials R.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;W. was found
round the neck of the third skeleton, and as
several people remembered having seen a big black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
retriever with Wotherall while he was staying at
the farm, it was pretty certain that the canine
remains were those of his dog. However, Mrs.
Griffiths, who appeared to be quite as astonished
as anyone at the discovery of the skeletons, still
stuck to her original story that Wotherall had left
the neighbourhood, taking his dog with him, and
against her statements Casson could only reiterate
his surmises. He was quite certain that Mrs.
Griffiths and her evil-faced son were guilty of
murder, that, having done away with Wotherall
and some other man by means of the stepping-stone,
they had deliberately set the same deathtrap
for him, and that he had only been saved
from falling into it by the apparition of his old
friend&rsquo;s dog; but he could not, of course, expect
the police to work up a case, which, from their
point of view, rested upon such an unsubstantial
foundation, and as on examination the skeleton
showed no evidence of foul play, there was no
alternative, the usual verdict of &ldquo;Death from misadventure&rdquo;
had to be returned.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a><span class="g">CHAPTER XIII</span><br />
<br />
THE PINES</h2>



<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Who</span> is the most interesting person in this
institution?&rdquo; my friend Dr. Custance remarked, repeating
my words. &ldquo;If you mean from your point
of view&mdash;ghosts, I should say Dacre, George Richard
Dacre. He is pretty old now&mdash;close upon seventy,
and very possibly you have never heard of him.
The case, with which he was somewhat closely
connected, took place in Cumberland about forty
years ago, and the spot is still said to be haunted.
If you would like to hear all about it, come along,
and I will introduce you to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Custance led me into a room, where an old
man, with a glistening bald head and white beard,
sat, leaning back in his chair, and examining his
hands with an air of strange intensity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dacre,&rdquo; Custance remarked, &ldquo;I have
brought you a visitor, a Mr. Elliot O&rsquo;Donnell, who is
very interested in the supernatural, and would
much like to hear some of your experiences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man raised his eyes; they did not look
at me, but beyond, far beyond, into a world that
seemed known only to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have only had one experience,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
that was a long while ago; so long that, at times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
it seems as if it must have happened to me in another
incarnation, when I was something out of
doors&mdash;a pine or an elm&mdash;something growing in a
wood. I can still, occasionally, smell resin, after
one of those long hot summers we used to have,&mdash;seventy
or eighty years ago,&mdash;and occasionally
hear the wind, the deliciously cool, evening breezes,
rustling and sighing, as it were, through my branches
and fanning my perspiring bark. Sit down, and I
will tell you all about it.</p>

<p class="dots">.<span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a cold night. Rain had been falling
steadily not only for hours but days&mdash;the ground
was saturated. As I walked along the country
lane, the slush splashed over my boots and trousers.
To my left was a huge stone wall, behind which I
could see the nodding heads of pines; and through
them the wind was rushing, making a curious
whistling sound&mdash;now loud, now soft&mdash;roaring and
gently murmuring. The sound fascinated me. I
fancied it might be the angry voice of a man and
the plaintive pleading of a woman, and then, a
weird chorus of unearthly beings, of grotesque
things that stalked across the moors and crept
from behind huge boulders. Nothing but the
wind was to be heard. I stood and listened to it.
I could have listened for hours, for I felt in harmony
with my surroundings&mdash;lonely. The moon showed
itself at intervals from behind the scudding clouds
and lighted up the open landscape to my right. A
gaunt hill covered with rocks, some piled up
pyramidically, others strewn here and there; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
few trees with naked arms tossing about and looking
distressfully thin beside the more stalwart
boulders; a sloping field or two, a couple of level
ones, crossed by a tiny path; and the lane, where
I stood. The scenery was desolate&mdash;not actually
wild, but sad and forlorn; and the wood by my
side lent an additionally weird aspect to the place,
which was pleasing to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suddenly I heard a sound&mdash;a sound, familiar
enough at other times; but, at this hour, and in
this place, everything seemed different. A woman
was coming along the road&mdash;a woman in a dark
cloak, with a basket under her arm; and the
wind was blowing her skirts about her legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked at the trees. One singularly gaunt and
fantastic one appalled me. It had long, gnarled
arms, and two of them ended in bunches of twigs
like hands&mdash;yes, they were exactly like hands&mdash;huge,
murderous-looking hands, with bony fingers. The
moonlight played over and around me&mdash;I was
bathed in it. I had no business to be on the earth&mdash;my
proper place was in the moon. I no longer
thought it&mdash;I knew it. The woman was close
at hand. She stopped at a little wicket gate
leading into the lane skirting the northern boundary
of the wood. I felt angry; what right had she
to be there, interrupting my musings with the
moon! The tree with the human hands appeared
to agree. I saw anger in the movements of its
branches&mdash;anger, which soon blazed into fury.
It gave a mighty bend towards her, as if longing
to rend her in pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I followed the woman; and the wind howled
louder and louder through those rustling leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long I scrambled on I do not know.
As soon as the moonlight left me, I fell into
a kind of slumber&mdash;a delicious trance, broken
only by the restless murmurings, the sighings and
groanings of the wind. Sweeter music I never
heard. Then came a terrible change. The charm
of my thoughts was broken&mdash;I awoke from my
reverie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A terrific roar broke on my ears, and a perfect
hurricane of rain swept through the wood. I
crept cold and shivering beneath the shelter of the
trees. To my surprise a hand fell on my shoulder:
it was a man, and, like myself, he shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he whispered, in a strangely
hoarse voice. &lsquo;Who are you? Why are you
here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe me if I told you,&rsquo; I
replied, shaking off the man&rsquo;s grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&mdash;tell me,&rsquo; he rejoined; &lsquo;for God&rsquo;s sake
tell me.&rsquo; He was frightened&mdash;trembling with
fright. Could it be the storm, or was it&mdash;was it
those trees?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told him then and there why I had trespassed.
I was fascinated&mdash;the wind&mdash;and the trees&mdash;had
led me thither.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; he whispered; &lsquo;I am fascinated.
It is a long word, but it describes my sentiments.
What did the wind sound like?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told him. He was a poor, common man,
and had no poetical ideas. The wildly romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
had never interested him&mdash;he was but an ignorant
labouring man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sounded like sighing, groaning, and so on?&rsquo;
he said, repeating my words, and shifting uneasily
from one foot to another. He was cold,
horribly cold. &lsquo;Was that all?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, of course. Why ask?&rsquo; I replied. Then
I laughed. This stupid, sturdy son of toil had
been scared; to him the sounds had been those of
his moorland bogies&mdash;things he had dreaded in
his infancy. I told him so. He didn&rsquo;t like to hear
me make fun of him. He didn&rsquo;t like my laugh, and
he persisted: &lsquo;Was that all you heard?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I grew impatient, and asked him to explain
what he meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I thought I heard a scream,&mdash;a
cry. Just as if some one had jumped out on
some one else and taken them unawares. Maybe
it was the wind&mdash;only the wind. But it had an
eerie sound.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man was nervous. The storm had
frightened away whatever little wit he may have
possessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come, let us be going,&rsquo; I said, moving off in
the direction of the wall. I wanted to find a new
exit; I was tired of paths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man kept close to me. I could hear his
teeth chatter. Accidentally his hand brushed
against mine. His flesh was icy cold. He gave
a cry as if a snake had bitten him. Then the
truth flashed through me. The man was mad.
His terror, his strange manner of showing it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
now this sudden shrinking from me revealed it
all&mdash;he was mad&mdash;the moon and trees had done
their work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going that way,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;come
along with me. I want to see which of the trees
it was that cried.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His voice was changed; he seemed suddenly
to have grown stranger. There was no insanity
in his tone now. But I knew the cunning of the
insane, and I feared to anger him, so I acquiesced.
What an idea! One of the trees had cried! Did
he mean the wind?</p>

<p>&ldquo;He grew sullen when I jeered at him. He led
me to a little hollow in the ground, and I noticed
the prints of several feet in the wet mud. Then I
saw something which sent the cold blood to my
heart. A woman bathed in blood lay before me.
Somehow she was familiar to me. I looked again&mdash;then
again. Yes, there was the dark shawl, the
basket&mdash;broken, it was true, with the contents
scattered; but it was the same basket. It was the
woman I had seen coming down the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My God, whatever is this!&rsquo; The man by my
side spoke. He swayed backwards and forwards
on his feet, his face white and awful in the moonlight.
He was sick with terror. &lsquo;Oh God, it is
horrible&mdash;horrible!&rsquo; Then, with a sudden
earnestness and a crafty look in his eyes, he bent
over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is it?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Who is the poor
wretch?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him peer into her face, but he didn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
touch her&mdash;he dreaded the blood. Then he started
back, his eyes filled with such savageness as I
had never seen in any man&rsquo;s before. He looked
a devil&mdash;he was a devil. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my wife!&rsquo; he
shrieked. &lsquo;My wife!&rsquo; His voice fell and turned
into what sounded like a sob. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Mary. She
was coming back to Helvore. It was her cry.
There&mdash;see it&mdash;confound you! You have it on
your arm&mdash;your coat&mdash;all over you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He raised his hand to strike me. The moonlight
fell on it&mdash;a great coarse hand&mdash;and I noticed,
with a thrill of horror, a red splash on it. It was
blood. The man was a murderer. He had killed
his wife, and, with all the cunning of the madman,
was trying to throw the guilt on me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sprang at him with a cry of despair. He
kicked and bit, and tried to tear my arms from
his neck; but somehow I seemed to have ten
times my usual strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all the time we struggled a sea of faces
waved to and fro, peering down at us from the
gaunt trees above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He gave in at length. I was no longer obliged
to hold him with an iron grip, and help came
eventually in the shape of a policeman, who seemed
to grasp the situation quite easily. There had been
a murder; the man I had secured was known to
him. He was a labouring man of unsteady habits;
he had been drinking, had met and quarrelled
with his wife. The rest was to be seen in the
ghastly heap before us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wretch had no defence. He seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
dazed, and eyed the bloodstains on his face and
clothes in a stupid kind of way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I slipped five shillings into the policeman&rsquo;s
hand when we parted. He thanked me and
pocketed the money; he knew his position and
mine too; I was a gentleman, and a very plucky one
at that. So I thought as I walked back to my
rooms; yet I lay awake and shuddered as visions
of the nodding heads of pines passed before me;
and from without, across the silent lanes and fields,
there rose and fell again the wailing of a woman&mdash;a
woman in distress.</p>

<p class="dots">.<span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The murder in the wood was an event in
Helvore. The people were unused to such tragedies,
and it afforded them something to talk
about for many weeks. The evidence against
the husband was conclusive. He had been caught
red-handed, he was an habitual drunkard, and he
paid the penalty for his crime in the usual manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left Helvore. I had seen enough of Cumberland
and thirsted for life in London once again.
Yet, often at night, the sighing of the wind in the
trees sounded in my ears, bidding me visit them
once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day as I was sitting by my fire with a
pile of books at my side, taking life easily, for I
had nothing to do but to kill time, my old friend,
Frank Leethwaite, looked me up. He had been
at Sedbergh with me in the far-off eighties, and he
was the only friend of the old set with whom I
had been out of touch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He had not altered much, in spite of a moustache
and a fair sprinkling of white hairs. I should have
known him had I met him anywhere. He was
wearing an Albert coat, and his face was red with
healthy exercise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How are you, old chap?&rsquo; he exclaimed,
shaking hands in the hearty fashion of true friendship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I winced, for he had strong hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fit enough,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;only a bit bored. But
you&mdash;well, you look just the same, and fresh as a
daisy.&rsquo; I gave him the easy-chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m first rate&mdash;plenty of work. I&rsquo;m a
journalist, you know. It&rsquo;s a bit of a grind, but
I&rsquo;m taking a holiday. You look pale. Your eyes
are bad?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told him they got strained if I read much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I daresay you will think me mad,&rsquo; he went
on, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m going to ask you rather a curious
question. I remember you used to be fond of
ghosts and all sorts of queer things.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I nodded. We had had many discussions on
such subjects, in my study at school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a member of the New Supernatural
Investigation Society.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I smiled doubtfully. &lsquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t say
it has discovered much. The name is high-sounding,
but that is all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind. Some day, perhaps, we shall
show the public what we can do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leethwaite lit a cigarette, puffed away in
silence for a few seconds, and then went on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am undertaking a little work for the Society
now!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In Cumberland. Ever been there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I nodded. Leethwaite was very much at his
ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Been to Helvore?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew by instinct he would mention the
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thought I looked ill, and told me I had been
overdoing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is merely a case of &ldquo;flu,&rdquo;&rsquo; I assured
him. &lsquo;I had it six weeks ago, and still feel the
effects.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(&ldquo;The woman in the hollow was before me. I
saw again her shabby shawl and the blood round her
throat.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There was a murder down there a short time
ago.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I heard of it,&rsquo; I remarked casually. &lsquo;It was
a wife murder, I believe.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, just a common wife murder, and the
fellow was caught and hanged.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then why the ghost?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, that is the odd part of it,&rsquo; Leethwaite
said slowly, leaning back in his chair, his long legs
stretched out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have heard from two Helvore residents
that screams have been heard in the wood about
twelve o&rsquo;clock at night. Not the time for practical
jokers, and the Cumberland peasantry are too
superstitious to try their pranks in unsavoury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
spots. Besides, from what I have heard, the spot
is not only unsavoury, it is singularly uncanny.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They haven&rsquo;t seen anything?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, only heard the cries, and they are so
terribly realistic that no one cares to pass the place
at night; indeed, it is utterly banned. I mentioned
the case to old Potters&mdash;you must have heard of him,
he used to write a lot for the <cite>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</cite>&mdash;and
he pressed me to go down and investigate.
I agreed; then I thought I would look you up.
Do you remember your pet aversion in the way of
ghosts?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I nodded. &lsquo;Yes, and I still have the aversion.
I think locality exercises strange influence over
some minds. The peaceful meadow scenery holds
no lurking horrors in its bosom; but in the lonely
moorlands, full of curiously moulded boulders, one
sees, or fancies one sees, grotesque creatures, odd
and ill-defined as their surroundings. As a child
I had a peculiar horror of those tall, odd-shaped
boulders, with sneering faces&mdash;featureless, it is
true, but sometimes strangely resembling the faces
of humans and animals. I believe the wood may
be haunted by something of this nature&mdash;terrible
as the trees.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You know the wood?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do. And I know the trees.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again in my ears the wind rushed, as it had on
that memorable night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you come with me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leethwaite eyed me eagerly. The same old
affection he had once entertained for me was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
ripening in his eyes; indeed it had always remained
there. Should I go? An irresistible
impulse seized me, a morbid craving to look once
more at the blood-stained hollow, to hear again the
wind. I looked out of the window; the sky was
cold and grey. There were rows and rows of
chimneys&mdash;chimneys everywhere&mdash;and an ocean of
dull, uninviting smoke. I began to hate London
and to long for the countless miles of blue
sea, and the fresh air of the woods. I assented
though my better judgment would have had me
refuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;I will go. As to the ghost,
it may be there, but it is not what you think; it
is not the apparition of a man. It may be, in
part, like a man, but it is one of those cursed
nightmares I have always had. I shall see it,
hear it shriek&mdash;and if I drop dead from fright,
you, old man, will be to blame.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leethwaite was an enthusiast, and psychical
adventure always allured him. He would run
the risk of my weak heart, he said, and have me
with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand times I prepared to go back on
my word; a thousand tumultuous emotions of
some impending disaster rushed through me. I
felt on the border of an abyss, dark and hopeless;
I was pushed on by invisible and unfriendly hands.
I knew I must fall; I knew that those black depths
would engulf me eternally. I took the plunge.
We talked over Sedbergh days, and arranged our
train to the North. Leethwaite looked very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
boyish, I thought, as he rose to go, and stood
smiling in the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was all kindness; I liked him more than
ever. And yet, somehow, as we stood looking at
one another, a grey shadow swept around him,
and an icy pang shot through my heart.</p>

<p class="dots">.<span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span><span class="dot">.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was night once more, and the moonlight
poured in floods from over the summit of the
knoll where the uncanny boulders lay. Every
object stood silhouetted against the dark background.
A house, with its white walls, stood grim
and silent; the paths running in various directions
up and alongside the hill were made doubly clear
by the whiteness of the beams that fell on them.
There were no swift clouds, no mists to hide the
brilliance of the stars, and it was nearly midnight.
The air was cold, colder than is usual at Helvore,
and I shivered. Leethwaite stood by my side. I
glanced apprehensively at him. Why did he
stand in the moonlight? What business had he
there? I laughed, but I fear there was but little
mirth in the sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wish you would stop that infernal noise,&rsquo;
he said; &lsquo;I am pretty nervous as it is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; I whispered; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t do it again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did, and he edged sharply away from
me. I looked over his head. There was the
gaunt tree with the great hands. I fancied
once again the branches were fingers. I told
him so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, man, keep quiet,&rsquo; he replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
&lsquo;You are enough to upset any one&rsquo;s nerves.&rsquo; He
looked at his watch for the hundredth time. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
close on the hour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I again looked at the trees and listened. Suddenly,
although there had been absolute silence
before, I heard a faint breathing sound, a very
gentle murmur. It came from over the distant
knoll. At first very soft and low, but gradually
getting louder and louder, it rushed past us into
the wood beyond. I saw once more the great
trees rock beneath it; and again I heard those
voices&mdash;those of the woman and the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leethwaite looked ill, very ill, I thought.
I touched him on the arm. &lsquo;You are not frightened,&rsquo;
I said; &lsquo;you&mdash;a member of the New Supernatural
Investigation Society?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Something is going to happen,&rsquo; he gasped.
&lsquo;I feel it&mdash;I know it. We shall see the murder&mdash;we
shall know the secret of death. What is
that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away in the distance the tap-tapping of shoes
came through the still night air. Tap&mdash;tap&mdash;tap,
down the path from the knoll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I clutched Leethwaite by the arm. &lsquo;You
think you will see the murder, do you? And the
murderer!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leethwaite didn&rsquo;t answer. His breath came
in gasps; he looked about him like a man at
bay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the murderer! Ha! It comes from
there. See, it is looking at us from those trees.
It is all arms and legs; it has no human face. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
will drop to the earth, and then we shall see what
happens.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tap, tap, tap&mdash;the steps grew louder&mdash;nearer
and nearer they came. The great shadows stole
down, one by one, to meet them. I looked at
Leethwaite. He was fearfully expectant; so
was I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman came tripping along the path. I
knew her in an instant&mdash;there was the shabby
shawl, the basket on her arm&mdash;it was the same.
She approached the wicket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked at Leethwaite. He was spellbound with
fear. I touched his arm. I dragged him with me.
&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; I whispered, &lsquo;we shall see which of us is
right. You think the ghostly murderer will resemble
us&mdash;will resemble men. It will not. Come.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dragged him forward. He would have fled,
but I was firm. We passed through the gate&mdash;we
followed the figure as it silently glided on. We
turned to the left. The place grew very dark as
the trees met overhead. I heard the trickling of
water and knew we were close to the ditch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gazed intently at the pines. When would
the horror drop from them? A sickly terror
laid hold of me. I turned to fly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my surprise Leethwaite stopped me. He
was all excitement. &lsquo;Wait,&rsquo; he hissed. &lsquo;Wait.
It is you who are afraid. Hark! It is twelve
o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; And as he spoke, the clock of the parish
church slowly tolled midnight. Then the end
came. An awful scream rang out; so piercing and
so full of terror that I felt the blood in my heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
stand still. But no figure dropped from the pines.
Not from the pines, but from behind the woman a
form darted forward and seized her by the neck.
It tore at her throat with its hands, it dragged
and hurried her into the moonlight; and then, oh
damning horror, I saw its face!&mdash;it was my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this, the &ldquo;Falstaff&rdquo; Edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Works,
the order in which the plays are presented is that of the
first folio edition of 1623&mdash;&ldquo;Pericles,&rdquo; which was not
included in that edition, and the poems being added at
the end of the volume. No new reading of the text is
attempted; and only those variations from the text of the
early editions are included which have been accepted by
the best Shakespearean critics. The task of the present
Editor has consisted solely in the choice between the
readings of these critics, where they disagree. For the
most part the text of Delius has been followed.</p>
